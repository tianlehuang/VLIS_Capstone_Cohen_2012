@samplereality That's like the literary version of reality television--I guess the comedy would depend on the persona of the writer.
@samplereality I wonder if Kenny Goldsmith's "uncreative writing" could ever be effectively applied to stand-up?
Looking forward to a world with @LAGameSpace in it!
@geedraines @markcmarino The unreliability and conflicted nature of witness reports, the diff. realities and implicit desires of Tweeters...
@geedraines @markcmarino Think on medium-specific properties of Twitter: capacity for asymmetrical communication, multp. locations & voices
@geedraines Oh, I like this: a kind of neo-War of the Worlds but using Twitter? The literary critic in me very much approves. @markcmarino
If you highlight over eVa's post, there's a secret message in binary that converts to "memento mori" #elit #speculat1on http://t.co/v9XvPg76
Speculat1on players were emailed poem fragments; pieced together they form calligraphic momento mori in ASCII #elit http://t.co/v9XvPg76
On the last day of http://t.co/P1TQ1xwd, players have taken to producing palindromic poetry on the forums #elit http://t.co/yKrfnuVx
Final, live event of http://t.co/P1TQ1xwd tonight, 8pm CST!Rogue algos, ultrafast Black Swans, temporal entanglements @ http://t.co/UrDNQLJA
RT @tbxsmason: "New Media, Art, and Science" by Geert Lovink (2005). Fantastic essay on culture of new media. #eLit #transmedia http://t.co/Z9I6er1r
@argass @gainesian And perhaps join forces with @markcmarino and @netprov_robwit for more #netprov to experiment further with this form?
@argass @gainesian I'm an errant user myself. But we could make a hashtag for our class and piggyback off some good ones: #elit, #critcode.
@ArloPub We're all expendable, Arlo. It's the precarious life for you philosophically-committed capitalists. #fail12
@gainesian Where's Matthew Davis' retro-snark when you need him?
@anticharismatic Remind me to never give you directions.
@anticharismatic At least it never gets to this point. (I'd love to know what authors they were debating.) http://t.co/zMfaqe9t …
@chouxsalad On second thought, enjoy might be the wrong word. Appreciate the dialectical struggle?
@markcmarino That's why I enjoy collaborative writing. The harshest critiques are typically from your fellow contributors.
@gainesian Looks like #fail12 turned into a financial Ender's Game.
@gainesian @argass Maybe next semester, we should use Twitter. It would instantly open up conversation beyond a forum/blog.
@gainesian Agreed. It's very peculiar.
@gainesian Consuela and Lisa may be at the top of the charts, but is a flashcrash imminent?
@gainesian Note his absence in this love-triangle talk. Is he day trading? Perhaps they're focused on the wrong kind of exchange. #fail12
@stargould @shaviro I was just thinking MoMA's announcement today that they acquired 14 videogames (Pac-Man, etc) perfectly illustrated this
@stargould Noble of you to try. His talk is a singularity.

@stargould I'm listening now :)
RT @stargould: The time of M's virtual - appears simultaneously too early & too late. Is an abstract that can be realized in thought -  phaps then in time
RT @christianbok: They flick out Tweet-poems, like sparks in a factory—(probably inevitable…): @hayflick
RT @kathiiberens: Want a taste of #elit before #MLA13? Check out #FAIL12 #Twitterfiction in progress rt now: 3 investors jockey for $$$ & luv. @consualtants
@stargould nice! Is pat there?

@theskinnyperth also I don't endorse this message
RT @theskinnyperth: The West Australian building evacuated, no indication yet of why, but pretty sure it's not an outbreak of quality journalism. @beejep
Aw no Spec Ops for best game? #ggtv
ERMAGERD EXKERM #ggtv
My game of the year tied with Journey and Spec Ops: The Line. All hit me right in the feels #ggtv
Oh god Journey, I still get shivers hearing the soundtrack #ggtv
Aaaaand I'll hold my congratulations for the season until it's on in Perth in a few hours! #ggtv
RT @goosemangus: MERRY XMAS #ggtv tweeters! Best audience ever, thank you all so much for all your msgs and tweets! See you all next year!
RT @Sydski: And there it is. Series 8 done and dusted. Thanks to the best viewers a show could ask for.. We’ll be back on Feb 12th 2013.” #ggtv
@HarrisonTheFan It was really interesting to play and had very cool ideas, but I couldn't justify paying a sub for it
@HarrisonTheFan I played SW for a bit but after a month when my sub lapsed I really struggled to find a reason to go back #ggtv
@Serrels webbers are pretty amazing, have you made a roast with it? Is it a coal bbq?
RT @rustyrockets: On my way to #PerthArena, first comic to play there. And last - the finale involves clumsy pyrotechnics.
RT @paulverhoeven: Well played, ser. “@beejep: @paulverhoeven Hey check out that girl in the denim shorts”

@pitty77 Just to keep things above board, search "Australia v South Africa cricket live stream" in google. There's a few options there
HEY CHANNEL 9 I'M IN PERTH AND STREAMING THE CRICKET LIVE ON THE INTERNET #WACA #AusVSa
@johnsy83 But people are going to go regardless. Hell you'd be lucky to get a ticket today.
So it's the biggest game played in Perth for years and Channel 9 doesn't show it live in Perth. Are you allergic to ratings #ch9? #ausvsa
It's pilaf time mutha-trucka

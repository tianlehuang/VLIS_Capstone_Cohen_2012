@Tizabet I may have to try it. I woke right up, sure that this time I'd bitten right through it.
RT @HellaCreates: This video is going public tomorrow - what do you guys think? http://t.co/tiqzoftC
@aliceandstuff Most people get the drinking rules and risks by now, time to drop the weeeed knowledge, man. :: rubs sore eyes ::
@aliceandstuff All that whaa whaa and none of the Informing of the People, it's all "oh go read a thing" that nobody will.
@aliceandstuff non-smoking rules. If you live in an apt. that prohibits smoking, they can kick you out. Also, not in public, zoning, etc.
@aliceandstuff I suspect every single neighbor has been "celebrating". I wish they'd talk more about the rules, and that it now falls under-
@aliceandstuff I know a couple down there getting their license for tomorrow! BUT, I'm real tired of being saturated with weeeed. :wheeze:
@aliceandstuff I want to create an 80's cover band called "Aristocracy in the Flower Garden" now.
@bm0nies @mcabain Or a *cough* "solution".
@mcabain :D
If I could stop biting my tongue in my sleep so hard I can't eat, that'd be neat.
@aliceandstuff @johnroderick Friendly reminder: Some folks would happily be of service if we could be helpful in achieving your goals.
@mcabain I had to dissuade SOMEONE from trying that in the wee hours over a stereo speaker last week. ^.~
3 videos in this @johnroderick talk were pretty good, but this http://t.co/eZFY5bPl helps elucidate things for me. Fogginess lifting? Hope!
@KenPlume The best part about and of those or Craig Ferguson is the potential for any of them to participate musically. #wishlist
@aliceandstuff My ex loved olives, and would chase me around with olive breath because he delighted in my disgust. He was terrible!
@bm0nies I LOVE the Mario Party series (put on your camp goggles, it is so silly!), Sonic's party game was OK, not as silly.
@chicazul Downtown once at a light & a sight-limited lady just hooked my arm & ran off once we across. I felt like a stone in a pond. Skip!
Can I have a light saber cane for Christmas? http://t.co/zdUH9b18 If I promise to stay classy?
@ckwright See but now I also want to be a background weirdo in a coffee shop to inspire you :D
@ckwright Do eeeet! Don't even say "I can't draw!" Just make them while having beers or something!
For my next I-need-to-keep-the-lights-on Live Drawing session, tempted to have @ckwright note all OH chats from coffee shops as suggestions.
@aliceandstuff And this explains a lot of why I couldn't make comics while I worked. :/ Stupid creativity peak times.
Dove is trolling me. I was talking about matching sweaters & legwarmers & she said "You know it isn't the 80's... :trollface:" I AM NOT 55.
@ghalidrim @mariafi @SierraHouk I wasn't quiiite done. http://t.co/AnJhr88P http://t.co/1kdxXgbq (Bonus: "Cats" and "Pie" in the URLs)
@Zulahni Most gluteniest gluten ever. Could probably do gluten free, it seems like a familiar process to the 24 hour dough/batter I've done.
@joshacagan @ckwright Those are my coffee safewords.
@aliceandstuff Dove and I actually had leftovers. We tried to eat it all like we were still in our 20's. :: BURP :: Sorry. XD
@ckwright That is some coffee.
Brace yourself, @aliceandstuff ! Incoming! (cc: @mariafi @ghalidrim @SierraHouk ) http://t.co/rWR0WuKK http://t.co/xZnKdLgN
@mariafi @ghalidrim @SierraHouk That scale is a size XL cookie sheet, and it bled over the edge. So much to learn about dough, still.
@mariafi @ghalidrim @SierraHouk I picked up a dough from DeLaurenti. I did not anticipate scale. I could have made 3 pizzas that size.
Let the torture of the Fishers begin! http://t.co/t6cblVSd @mariafi @ghalidrim (cc: @SierraHouk )
@Zulahni http://t.co/jEYNMdmT
@Molly23 Will this #mollyclicks show be available to view later or maybe buy a copy of a la recent JoCoJoRoShow?
@srj68 This seems likely, and kind. But, you know.
@aliceandstuff Um, I think he actually has been on Wait, Wait as a guest... but I could be mistaken.
@Zulahni Or snow check. Either will do. :)
Someone buy me a beer to cry in.
@aliceandstuff I always find that a bit unsettling.
... they rung me up as a Senior Citizen at the grocery. I was given the "Over 55" discount. I AM NOT EVEN 40 YET. JEEZE, LOUISE.
@hijinksensue @Molly23 That is "Moaning Myrtle"! It sounds very pretty, and I hope we get to hear lots of and about it! :)
@chicazul You are welcome!
@chicazul TA DA! http://t.co/J4gGLsQD
@chicazul This may take a few minutes, because I have to do it visually. :)
The internet is really trying hard to woo me. http://t.co/a810EQ1o
It looks like somebody in the Bahamas may be using http://t.co/DibxzSVI on a paddleboard. Boy I hope they take pictures.
I couldn't wait for the hot cocoa. Dove made stifled hilarity faces when I described the fruity notes. I do NOT have a cocoa problem.
@vixy Re: Tumblr jar of good things, http://t.co/RY2ROMZG Think I got the keychain notebook at $1 store, then stickers. Portable = easier?
@HelloTheFuture I do, I do! They do seem to go bad more quickly that way... but I like them cold!
@bm0nies Moms by default make better cookies, though ... so. There's that!
I imagine it'd be a lot of stands to take this year, but I really hope @DougBenson eventually writes something for Jen Kirkman's MA'AM.
@joshacagan That is eerily like Hamster Dance... and yet... I think I'm in love. Adding that to my #wishlist ! :D
@joshacagan I want to say "Lip-Diddling Sound is the name of my something coverband", but I'm too busy with hysterics and lip-diddling!
@chicazul Yes ma'am! ::SALUTE::
@Zulahni @mariafi @ghalidrim @bm0nies @chicazul @mcabain Wanted to go to it for the 2yr. & couldn't. Going if I have to be wheeled in.
@NosmoRex Oh I love it unironically! I don't know how the fit would be, or if extensive tailoring would be required, but PIZAZZ.
@Zulahni Go go go! I would love to see familiar people!
I always forget about this place until I walk by. http://t.co/ifStsxSM Someday I'm going to get a bright red striped suit. #wishlist
Is anyone else going to http://t.co/aaJM0NF8 ?
@mariafi @ghalidrim I try at least once a year to go there for small amounts of salt meats & nostalgia. Everything there is scrumptious!
:: lip smacking :: http://t.co/kAZn4Luy (That is truffle oil on some of the bread.)
@Tiffanysblogs Hot Rod, indeed! I think the Coulton Proximity is giving him some kind of power ups, though he might suggest the reverse. :)
@MizLzie YAY! It arrived in tact! I went to the PO during a RAINSTOOOOORM, I feared it might have gotten too damp.
@SierraHouk It isn't the worst, but Godiva White Chocolate Liqueur is SO MUCH better. If your year 21 to-do list will allow.
@mariafi @ghalidrim Bonus: Cheese girl was a Whovian. :D (I was wearing http://t.co/ociNr4fn )
@puckk By that point, I'd just end up with a milkshake. :D
@HellaCreates I weep in despair for all of my hungry friends. I should be feeding all of you! I'm letting down my genetics, man!
@puckk Probably just raw, I made banana bread too recently. Easy a-peel-ing breakfast! har har. *cough*
Score: A bunch of organic bananas from Pike Place for ONE dollar.
Tomorrow's hot cocoa plan: Valrhona powdered cocoa. Oh yes, today's shopping went well. Thank you @mariafi @ghalidrim
Tomorrow's pizza plan: Aged raw milk Manchego, Provolone, NY Pepperoni, Nostrano salami, mushrooms, and fresh basil, sauce.
Apparently DeLaurenti's has an upstairs. Perhaps I'd assumed it was just wine? Tomorrow's shopping is going to be *fun*. And delicious.
"They put their things together and a kid comes out. Science!" - @joshacagan on a tennis match of a #BitofaChat, keep your eye on the ball!
@ckwright Subscribed'd!
@joshacagan There's a YouTube video for that. http://t.co/ij7lUnuN
Next tour bus companion suggestion: http://t.co/HWzPT6vk
@bm0nies I don't know! I've still got like, 2 lbs. of them to eat. Didn't pinch any from @TheDoubleclicks or @Molly23 ? ^_~
@SierraHouk P.S. Previous link did contain penguins.
Here's a thing I could have gone to today: http://t.co/s1BVsBxQ Ironically or unironically. Spell check suggest ultrasonically.
@beatonna But all the the MA'AM posts on Tumblr are starting to make me very happy.
@aliceandstuff You are the best according to the room full of belly laughs at your oatmeal-related jokes!
@bm0nies The nightmare gruel full of pills was odd. Thank goodness there are real Portland cookies here for me to eat instead! :)
Back is out for realz. Took nap & had the most horrifying nightmares about being taken apart while awake by helpful doctors in a hospital.
@chicazul @DovSherman You're always welcome! :D
@snoogans @aliceandstuff Alice had all the best ideas, then I drew stuff.
@puckk Homemade almond flavored whipped cream. :D
@snoogans Thank you!
@mariafi Oh yeah.
@mariafi Wait'll you hear part two of the stories I was telling you earlier. The Great Escape was my favorite part.
Something I learned tonight: Never, ever drink pre-packaged hot cocoa again. Melted chocolate + dairy = Me happy.
I heard a lot of nice things about @loganbonner tonight, so I think I'll follow him.
@chicazul Sweet dreams: http://t.co/BHF9MRFw http://t.co/8qozHtgO  ^.~
. @Molly23 portrait style http://t.co/lHs1wG0I , and this feels like a photobomb: http://t.co/ADcLL3LB
. @Dammit_Liz doing what she does best? http://t.co/3lZ5jB4I And also http://t.co/VfnaCzin cc: @stepto
@mariafi She is responsible for saying or not, but you are free to judge accordingly if there are future encounters - or to not have them!
@mariafi I'm awake! Editing photos!
RT @lostluck: Everyone singing @jonathancoulton 's Chiron Beta Prime for the end of #DammitHoliday http://t.co/PDAMYOj0
@chicazul The suit jacket, tie and vest thing was kind of killing me. :)
@Molly23 I was surprised at how Moaning Myrtle 's sound was so different, I don't know how to explain it other than "smoother".

@chrisamaphone comes up in some hackingbabble, I think they actually meant homomorphic when they said it
@sillyemd1 whatever did you do?
@chrisamaphone This meshes with my own intuitions to the point of triggering my Confirmation Bias Alarm, would like to talk more about it.
Any twitterfolk interested in brunch with me&sister before she leaves town? Probably needs to be not long after 10 since she's got a flight.

@eassumption @gwillen @chrisamaphone The (possibly well meaning) privileged person who gets more control, obvi. I never claimed high ground.
Deleting more than 75% of my tweets before or after tweeting them = it's time to log off.
@zacharyzsparks The analogy of an invisible fence seems apt. I have learned better than to stray anywhere new without someone in front.
@chrisamaphone @gwillen I say that just to be clear that I'm not trying to make virtue of vice here, if I was a better human I'd try harder.
@chrisamaphone @gwillen Sure! Turns out I'm weak, scared, and needy and people upset with me on Twitter hurts and feels bad.
@chrisamaphone yes, i was thinking about our conversations specifically
@chrisamaphone @gwillen The very human tendency towards digging in and defending one's public statements, of course, does nobody any favors.
The first rule of moral cowardice club is OH GOD DON'T TALK ABOUT MORAL COWARDICE CLUB.
@neurocy I mean, I get that's your argument but all of us are like 0-4 generations from a society that strictly segregated sexes socially.
@neurocy While agreeing that you've got a few of shades of gray there, your line does seems to apply to "gender-neutral 'congressman'."
@neurocy Not sure Aristotle agrees, Milton certainly doesn't. Also, When Harry Met Sally told me that boys and girls can't be friends.
@neurocy ... right, that's the problem isn't it?
RT @carloangiuli: PLEASE RT; MOOSE. RT @silby: http://t.co/EP4iXHrH
@neurocy (Sigh, wading in.) I see no basis for this. "No, I'm using 'congressman' in a gender-neutral sense" seems equiv to your argument.
@neurocy @chrisamaphone Oh yeah I was trying to remember that example Nico had it on facebook a little while back.
@ezyang also relevant somewhat http://t.co/CI5eoUqq
@simrob @ezyang Also check the related work from Linear Logical Algorithms, especially Greco's paper, if I recall.
@ezyang My paper "Linear Logical Algorithms" and the TR, Nigam & Miller's "Algorithmic Specifications in Linear Logic with Subexponentials"
@ezyang Logic programming is frequently nice for these, too.

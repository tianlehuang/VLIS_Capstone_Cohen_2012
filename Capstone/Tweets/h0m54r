Job applications: the main reason for the existence of thesauruses (thesauri?)
Just applied for my first job. Nerve-wracking as anything. Not sure I can cope with doing 19 more…
@RichardR I wish chat clients catered better for data hoarders.
@RichardR This wouldn't be as big a problem if Tab didn't sometimes accidentally send the cursor to the Search box when Command+Tabbing.
@RichardR For a while it would just lock up for a few minutes; now it never comes back.
@RichardR I can't search my Messages for Mac history as it locks up because it's too big.
Microsoft Word still thinks it's Tuesday. Bless.
@Robert88UK …I also misread it, and didn't notice until now. Weird.
@bikasuishin @ptj_tsubasa @cdROOTatNIX Oh dear…
@bikasuishin @ptj_tsubasa @cdROOTatNIX Does the original language make it sound more racist? My Japanese doesn't stretch far enough to tell…
@bikasuishin @ptj_tsubasa @cdROOTatNIX I read that as referring to the RIAA, MPAA, FBI throwing their weight around outside their borders.
@theshillito I'd probably just take the jp article and tidy up a machine translation tbh
ULTRA-PRISM don't have a(n English) Wikipedia article. If I didn't have to apply for jobs today I'd do something about this…
Why do NPower keep calling me?!
RT @KristysBakery: Its time for our annual Christmas charity raffle again - Antonio has made a house out of white chocolate and marzipan! http://t.co/lAFIcxih
Noticing that you said "lofts" rather than "lifts" an hour ago. :-/
The realisation that these lofts will never be properly fixed, as it costs money and the building is coming down within ten years.
RT @animemadman: Chunibyo Demo Koi ga Shitai! Episode 8 now available to view! http://t.co/YhcXctyZ http://t.co/2r8CIQx6
RT @mahjongjen: People often wonder why I prefer living in Japan. One example: Today's domestic flight is at 9:45. I have to be to the airport by 9:30. Lov
Been a bit of a domestic goddess this evening. Two dishwasher-fuls of dishes, freshly baked rolls, and spare room finally tidied!
Uh-oh… I fear the heating bill's about to go through the roof q_q
RT @snowinformation: Hi folks! The ECMWF weather chart which has just been released shows EXTREME cold within the 10 day time frame. Worse (or better) than 1987.
RT @secboffin: (localisation: mushy peas are what you get when you add THE NORTH to peas.)
RT @serafinowicz: RT @LittleSmudger: @serafinowicz .. does the naughty list really exist ?.. #PSQA I think ITV made Schofield burn it.
@RichardR This is why .example, .test, .invalid, and .localhost exist!
@virginmedia I just used a different address.
Apparently people didn't use Cover Flow. I thought I was the only one who found it of no interest…
Thinking of starting a pool on how long it'll be before the first naked picture of the Royal Foetus is published.
@Robert88UK Better get used to that, it'll be like that for the next 7 months. Then we'll switch to baby mode.
RT @Hatmage: Good old @realdonaldtrump is providing the humour again. Thanks for this @doddyuk http://t.co/IjeQzgBT
Home internet finally back up again. Hopefully it stays up until after the weekend at least.
RT @TheDailyBunny: Bunny keeps his ears warm during naps with help from his friend: http://t.co/VBKTitZK
"Click the confirmation link in the email we just sent you" *receives email with no confirmation link*
Oh, apparently I can't use my normal email address as it's attached to a @VirginMedia account that was closed a year ago.
Seriously, @VirginMedia? http://t.co/lqx4X9s7
@AskLloydsTSB *its
Everyone knows it's actually called a mesh! RT @RichardR RT @screamingloli YOU'RE CALLING THE FUCKING HASHTAG THING a waffle

It's interesting how most of Terra's sprites look like Chidori… #FullMetalPanic #FFVI
RT @theshillito: Can you still see some skin through leggings like you can with tights? I may have to investigate this further. #inb4arrested

Got a letter from Virgin Media this morning saying they're increasing our broadband prices. Bit of a cheek given the recent lack of service.
@Aria_Technology "No Thread specified. If you followed a valid link, please notify the administrator"
(Plus the fact that the link replaces the site, so you have yet to use the site at all, can't see or use it, but are to give feedback)
…or that when you click through to the survey to tell them this, the survey is full and not accepting responses. @TravelineTim
Not sure what is worse, the survey popup, the fact that it takes 30 seconds to dismiss… @TravelineTim
Unhomogenised hot chocolate ftl :-( http://t.co/9bITMdil
@RichardR Customer service has a one-message memory. This makes it far easier for them to be obstructive.
@gallivanette Me too!
@gallivanette Too many identify man-hate as a core of their identity.
@gallivanette For you it is. The problem is that there as many definitions of feminism as there are feminists.
Owww yawncramp why must you hurt so badly?
RT @JustEatUK: Fancy a meal on us tonight? RT & follow us before 5PM and you're in with a chance of #winning a £25 JUST EAT voucher! GO! #TakeawayTuesday
@_ChaseTheLight I don't think figmas can ring doorbells. If be pretty worried if I opened the door and there was just a figma standing there

@scattermoon Help! Help! I'm being repressed!
I was going to make a political tweet, but decided against it.
Hope the volume was turned down or no one happened to be around it at that point!
I was wondering why I wasn't getting any output from my "say" experiments last week. Turns out I was typing them into a remote work machine.
RT @scattermoon: I swear if this government saw a fire, they'd pour petrol on it. Then when the fire got worse, they'd decide they hadn't used enough petrol.
RT @Queen_UK: The Pope is on twitter. Let's hope it's not a parody. Can't stand those things. #reigning

RT @iFish12: I don’t even know what that means
RT @iFish12: h0m54r
@RichardR Strange. Last time I did that it was in-branch. Which bank? (So I can avoid them)
@RichardR (Or possibly Glasgow if you're lucky)
@RichardR Card services? Lloyds TSB for one have a completely separately run card services division—all anyone in branch can do's call India
Why do we reverse the order when using Japanese names in English but not Korean ones?
RT @Queen_UK: Have told Starbucks that they do not owe a "tall" amount of tax, or a "grande" amount of tax, but a "venti" amount of tax.
@scattermoon Yep, I'd forgotten that. Wonder if the effects of sleeping would be unaffected by the return trip…
@Hammy_UK As you write this, my brother's playing LotR on one…
@h0m54r @scattermoon Actually scratch that, you don't real-world age in Narnia, do you? I'm thinking of other temporal phenomena...
@scattermoon Disadvantage: ageing at about 150% of the typical rate.
@iFish12 @richardr On-screen display
@RichardR @ifish12 Doesn't that contradict what you said about wanting a Source button though?
@iFish12 @richardr Your other left...
@RichardR @ifish12 I do have to remind it every couple of hours that I'm still alive. Discovered that in the #NekoDesuAllNighter
@RichardR @ifish12 Guess that's the next generation; I have a Series 5 which has a nice Source button: http://t.co/7JdDUrWn
@iFish12 @richardr No, but they're awful, and they're a waste of manufacturing time that could be spent on a better product…

@Avar1c3 I’m interested!
@m4dh4tt3r yay! I’m so happy for you!
@sfslim not necessarily true. Some are very engaged with @ replies, but only actually follow a small number.
@KdotCdot *hugs*
@SonusExMachina I’ll be around.
RT @nicoles: My sincerest wish to burning man would be to move farther from the four month art-marathon, not closer. The art can be so much better!
Catching up with the backlog of photos, I just posted a bunch of sets on Flickr: http://t.co/OjOE6EF3
lots of shows, and some art.
RT @nicoles: A set of day&night photos of Transect Cascade, by the always phenomenal @yerdua http://t.co/gkaPJEbw
Svankmajer’s films are always such a delight. I really enjoyed “Surviving Life”. Thanks @ybca!
@qtrnevermore well, if you end up wanting a break, I’d love to have you join us.
@qtrnevermore @artfly you should both come! I only have one extra ticket, but I’m pretty sure it’s not sold out. Starts at 7:30
I have an extra ticket to see Jan Svankmajer’s “Surviving Life” at @ybca tonight. Who wants to come? http://t.co/lOeX1Piw
@LibbyBulloff Sounds like a great idea for a class! But, it’s far less accessible than just going out and photographing dancers.

@calebdenecour @RTSideQuest My life is short notice
@calebdenecour @RTSideQuest Neat! I'll send you more details as I make them up. Maybe we can work something out!
@tromboneforhire @DanielEgan You need to get to the second gen, then you'll have gone full squircle
RT @RTSideQuest: Our friends @CPCharity are having their annual Dinner Auction tonight! Here's hoping it goes great and brings in a boatload of $$ for kids!
@retroconcrete Roll in pudding?
Spartan Ops hiatus? Booooooo. Guess I won't be playing as much Halo 4 over the next month.
@Jfrosinski Grading labs is doing that? Huh. :P
I would like to reiterate my desire for a "shuffle" option on Hulu Plus/Netflix. Sometimes I want to watch a show, but don't care what ep.
I can't wait until @metrotwitapp is no longer a buggy mess on Win8/RT. So pretty, but so horrible to use
RT @HMXhenry: CAPTCHA, YOU ARE OFFICIALLY FREAKING ME OUT http://t.co/Iyu6OCUm
@skipdeez Check out gleek. I use it alongside MetroTwit. Haven't decided which to stick with. (http://t.co/OTM42VKM)
@RoosterTeeth No Xbox Music version?
@GilbyRanger I've heard that the hottest things can be found at Satay but I've never been
@GilbyRanger You're making this difficult...
@GilbyRanger Evesdropping a bit, what kind of spicy? Mexican spicy? Indian spicy? Or something else?
I fear I may be over-engineering this spreadsheet...
@sailortweek Give everyone hugs for me! And take some for yourself!
RT @wilw: This is the second time in three auctions this has happened. Don't bid on a CHARITY AUCTION if you're going to back out, jerks.
@AyapaOh Have you and my brother met yet? I have a feeling that you two would get along. Knives and cooking and whatnot
RT @jon_bois: me, on @Oatmeal and his shitty non-apology for a casual rape joke. http://t.co/babY4WNq
RT @UTAustin: Oldest living former #UT football player celebrates 100 years of life. Story and interview from @TheAlcalde http://t.co/H68vPNYO
Sports internet, I love you.
RT @KevinOnCFB: Obvious coaching candidate for Wisconsin to replace Bret Bielema would be #Pitt's Paul Chryst. Been a while since Pitt lost a coach anyway.
Get it together weather. This is how OCTOBER is supposed to feel, not December.
RT @edsbs: This, of course, is exactly how Auburn got rid of Gene Chizik.  http://t.co/0AwnwIZ8
@grufftech Having a failing or missing UPS is such a turn off.
I just Kermit arm flailed because I figured out how to do something in Excel that totally changes how I do printer supplies. My life is sad.
The character development in Spartan Ops continues to be awesome. I'd easily pay $15-20 for a second episode after this one wraps
@pullrich Exactly! Love the content, hate the design
The Yahoo Sports score bar thingy that I just experienced made the page so uncomfortable that I don't think I can ever go there again
@grufftech He doesn't cover the other side, where web admins have to sit in therapy with all the traumatized F5 keys
The calendar says December 3rd. The thermometer says 80 degrees. I just walked by a petting zoo on campus. My sanity had begun to slip away.
RT @IAmSpilly: OH MY GOD I AM BASICALLY THE SWEDISH CHEF
@IAmSpilly After your latest masterpiece all I can picture is you as Bane, "I am Louisville's cheesoning!"
RT @retroconcrete: why does "cheesoning" exist. why.
RT @sbnation: Louisville fans! Let @IAmSpilly welcome you to the ACC with one of his customary special recipes. http://t.co/QHaFyEjP
Feel like you should buy me a birthday/Christmas gift? Don't want me to know how much/little you spent? Buy me this: https://t.co/SxtYHIcf
RT @GBHunting: Oh dear GOD. Perfect. RT @sbnation: Jerry Jones deal with it dot gif http://t.co/i3bbxGjK
RT @runthedive: Why are so many people mad about NIU getting in the Orange Bowl? They're really good and play super fun football. Shut up already.
Holy crap these bowl matchups look awesome
@AnnaLavergne No, @logo_ brought me one that @Jfrosinski picked out
As much as I want to, I don't think I can stay awake through the rest of this game
But football! I love you! Please don't go...
Derrrrrrrp
Bah!
@IAmSpilly Spilly. TVs don't belong in the blender, Spilly.
RT @DanBeebe: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA GOD YOU SUCK NEBRASKA
Sigh
Good God Montee Ball
Need some anti-purple magic to win this one
Jinxed myself. 100.4 now
WTF Wisconsin?
@cuppycup Very very miniscule chance. Hinges on leapfrogging Clemson and being picked over KState
So if Harsin and Major are both on the sidelines, who the hell is in the booth?
@Kraft Yeah, booth was confused for a while too. Unrelated: heard you met my cousin today
I hate/love Case McCoy
@Kraft It was the right call, because the ball didn't go out of bounds nor did Texas get on it.
Fever still steady at 99.7. Blah.
This game is ridiculous, because I had absolutely no idea what to expect going in
McCoy just got Tuggle Snuggled
@WhoisDavidCoon If only I was well enough to have beer
What the? How did Wisconsin already score twice?
Huh. That's an odd rule. Half yardline instead of a touchback?
If this turns into a touchback, it may be proof of the purple magic turning orange
Yep.
Oh this game is not going to be fun
That sucks so much for Georgia
Go Domers
Oh my...
UG...a
Georgia how did you screw this up?
RT @sportspickle: Verne Lundquist doesn't know he looks exactly like Uga.
When a pretty girl knocks on your door, wakes you up from a nap, and hands you a fruit smoothie, you give her whatever she asks for.
@GilbyRanger No idea. I'm laid up with a stomach bug
This cup would usually be full of something and alcohol. Today it has blended fruit and water. http://t.co/uBmWXWhz
ROLL DWAGS
I feel like a fruit smoothie would be beneficial, but I just plain don't have the energy to make one
How is my body not out of fluids yet?
You know I'm not feeling well when I can't even be bothered to turn on two of Command Central's monitors
Certainly looked like an incomplete pass to me. Ball was spiraling, which implies the QB had control of it as it left his hand.
Fever, you weren't invited to this party.
@AnnaLavergne Not quite, but almost http://t.co/vY1VHPYD
@kayejohn88 Also your limbs aresort of numb but your joints are all on fire
@kayejohn88 Like something is in your stomach trying to eat/claw its way out
I have things that I want/need to do today, but I feel like death
@Jfrosinski Matte grey, white logo w/ orange trim
@B_DonCarlos Nope! White with a faint orange outline. Looks awesome
@B_DonCarlos Matte grey
I am in love with the Pokes' helmets
Sick on the last day of the college football season? Not okay, body.
@sbnation :(
Huh.
Tomorrow is the last day until next August that I get to use Command Central at full power :(
@kayejohn88 Oh really? What are you getting?
MACtion and a high chance of Gus-gasm makes for a great Friday night
:(
Go refs! Keep the MACtion going!
Teavana's Mudslide tea + a splash of coffee Baileys + a splash of hazelnut Kahlua = :D :D :D
#MACTION (!!!)
RT @HustleBelt: For those yet to experience overtime MAC football, you have to consciouslly remember to breathe. We've lost too many men over the years.

You can't get boosted from energy drinks

I'm always in the bathroom when I happen to see snapchat usernames tweeted. Then what comes next is only logical...
Sugar free red bull is the worst sugar free I've ever accidentally bought in my life

@StarlonH If only faving a tweet made it come true
all from my iphone while waiting for the bus
twitter is cool cuz I can see the same person express their disdain for rape jokes WHILE suggesting genocide for a group of individuals
Public buses are bought out and put back on the streets refurnished as private "land yachts." Wealthy children ride them for days.
@Mesokari @virissirin she better
By a few days I mean like two months.
I feel so accomplished after visiting the gym twice that I don't feel bad for taking a few days off. Repeat.
@mzenken @H0muasfuk no one knows that feel
@goldfishugu his ASS IS SPARKLING

Chewed off my very own head to get me out of this trap
@Yamaxanaduh I'm sure your positions oscillate
@Yamaxanaduh I bet he's on top (of the crest)
@iamaparty yeah that's interesting. Hmm. Maybe try dr horribles sing along whatever whatever (I don't remember the whole title haha)
@iamaparty I guess shrek totally does work tho because Farquad makes everyone believe he's the real hero while making shrek the enemy
@iamaparty I was mostly joking lol. Srsly tho I think it's a common trope in some texts, but its not usually the center of the plot/story
@virissirin can they break my rock hard nipple fists
@goldfishugu everyone loves dio. Especially dinosaur dio.
@tone765 maybe a Santa beard could compliment that grin
@iamaparty shrek
@c2switch can you draw me a Santa hat :>

RT @dril: someone hacked hte high score board on the java pacman game in monsanto .com's "For Fun" page. just a heads up
@goldfishugu the more I think about it, the more I realize it's true in like every aspect from storytelling to appearance to dialogue etc
@H0muasfuk fuck you every time I ask you to do it you never do. I gave you this idea.

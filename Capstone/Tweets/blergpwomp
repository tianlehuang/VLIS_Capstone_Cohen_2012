@ChrisGethard google hangouts better become a thing. i only got to hear 2 smiths songs, so my taste in music is still shitty.
@ChrisGethard you left in the middle of my musical education :(
@ChrisGethard how do i find said hangout?
There was a holdup at the 7/11 near my house this summer, but I still go there frequently to buy overpriced ice cream. #bravery
RT @Mike_Doughty_: New documentary about crazed alternative-neckwear aficionados called YOLO IN A BOLO
RT @mrdavehill: Erotic short story #17: This guy showed up to cut the lawn just like usual but then guess what happened. The lady at the house banged him.
@ChrisGethard Something that vague shouldn't be good advice, but I read it and holy shit I haven't felt so calm in a while.
I just started Breaking Bad a few days ago and I'm finding myself legit cheering @aaronpaul_8 on as he cooks meth.

It's Friday night and instead of going to the party I was invited to, I'm sitting in my room singing "Murf vs. Gimghoul."
RT @imjenengel: the true meaning of Christmas is that magical feeling you get when you go to the mall and don't run into anyone you went to high school with
@thermoso @chrisgethard true but this one is weird enough that none of them watched after like 5 minutes in :(
@ChrisGethard Such a weird episode to be introducing my friends to TCGS with. I'm fucking dying but I think they all think I'm insane.
@ChrisGethard what if I get kicked out of grad school for tcgs?
@drujohnston  I just saw a commercial for the show 1600 Penn and I think it might star a sandwich.
@ChrisGethard "Anyone who has the name 'get hard' has my attention." -My friend agreeing to watch #tcgs with me tonight

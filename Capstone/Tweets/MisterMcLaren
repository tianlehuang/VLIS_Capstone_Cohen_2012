@NathAt got the steam punk fashion book.  Many thanks,  I'm sure it will be quite helpful getting Sarah ready this week.
I'd hate to be annoying-keeps-coughing guy during Alison Bechdel's talk tonight.
Finger crossed that the devil's cocktail of over-the-counter remedies I whipped up earlier holds my cold symptoms in abeyance for 2 more hrs
@DavidNickle That looks lovely, in the usual creepy, Erik-is-so-damn-talented, way. Can't wait to read it.

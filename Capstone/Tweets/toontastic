@NilePowerRanger has done canny tonight, tried to make an awful lot for himself and the team. One of few to be honest.
RT @Hollyberryboo: Pards you silly man, risking Colo in a game of no importance
@TheRealArmitage have a squad big enough at the minute so he's having to play
@TheRealArmitage it's not like Sunday league he's playing in the top flight of football. He needs championship football on loan but we don't
@TheRealArmitage @nufcfans he's young and still learning. What you expecting, the finished article?
@NUFC4 alongside colo I'd have him still
RT @danwhitejourno: RT “@MsiDouglas: Favourite #nufc flag? The one that says 'F**k the recession, we're on a session'. Take that Osborne”
Brilliant noise from the Newcastle fans
RT @lee_ryder: Great flag in the #nufc end says: "Watching the lads al owa Europe"
@DarrelBirkett well done on getting home, now quick shower and meal then off to work you've got another journey back to work !
Pleased for Celtic they've deserved it
@DarrelBirkett impressive tweeting whilst driving I must say ;)
@NobbyNolano probably ranger to start
RT @DarrelBirkett: Ok, so the road from Durham to Concett
(A691) is nose to tail all the way as well. Excuse me but, fuck sake man!
RT @therealrobbo: Judging by the damage done to road signs and bus stops across Tyneside....not spreading salt has saved you a bit of money @NewcastleCC #Not
@HannahBebecca yeah me to, I love a bacon sarnie on christmas morning
RT @Lockers75: Anyone stuck on a1 and going north of Seaton Burn... the a184 route, via Tyne tunnel onto a19...is clear as a bell... good luck
@DarrelBirkett just hoping your well clear of Chester Le street and a1
RT @NUFCOfficial: Landed safely in Bordeaux #nufc
@Danielle92_ loads of it is freezing that's the big problem it's not really snow that's the problem. Yeah slush is crap. Love snow for Xmas
@Danielle92_ it's not as bad as 2 years ago that's for sure. The roads are the problem a1 stuck basically.
@Danielle92_ parts are, parts you wouldn't even know it had been snowing
RT @DarrelBirkett: I'd avoid A1/Chester le St turn off. Barely moving back to Wash Svs. A690 better but still slow in to Durham.

Near 2hrs for me so far ...
@DarrelBirkett took me 10mins to work out it was a gritter haha
@davidpick1987 @stephnufc @ldntoon that's right David it was you who told me :)
@StephNUFC @davidpick1987 @ldntoon wasn't there something a fair while back that we bring in more viewers than all but Man U?
@DarrelBirkett sure is I'm afraid
@StephNUFC @ldntoon I was told Espn have first choice?
@Ldntoon only if players don't get there so probably not. They don't care about fans
@DarrelBirkett you live durham don't you? Just stay where you are a little longer if I was you.
@GeordieK1r5ty think they took off a little while back
RT @GKGuruWoody: Mmmmm! Safe flight! http://t.co/CWhJ8Tux
RT @JoeBlack14: Horrific what's happened with that official in holland, Hope the young thugs get harshest possible conviction.
@SnedNE25 I'm expecting full 11 changed and full team of kids. Harper or Elliot on goal.
It's a shame @TheGadgetShow seems to support it's sponsors now when it comes to reviews. It's gone down hill since the other 2 left as well.
RT @LeazesTerrace: Cisse suggestion: fit him with an electric shock tag that goes off every time he's offside
Good important win, all did well. Very pleased and about time to be honest. Can't believe our injury luck tho. Hopefully all fit for Fulham
RT @Danielle92_: I see all the "sack pardew" divs from last week like him again.
Oh forgot Marvaux, his runs off the ball have been class and I've been impressed with Anita again
@garyschofield3 lol guess so.
We can't throw this away can we?
@dannysimpson looking very composed on the ball and he's not gone for cross every time he's looked for better ball, much better all round
Love how we had 2 players running to smash the second goal in the net, makes a change. They look like they want it.
RT @TartoonArmy: Ref bottled it on the second yellow for Caldwell. No surprise.
Not sure why Tiote is risking whatever injury he has by stopping on
Much better football from Newcastle, build up to first goal was brilliant play, best we've done in 6 months
Here they come out of the warmth in to the cold, soft bastards ;)
Hoping everyone is inside keeping warm, stadium is dead
@MsiDouglas you sure? They've just said on twitter their talking Chelsea. Best get swotting up on past managers there's plenty!
@Iwantcurlyhair2 that long? I'm going for his first touch
Who's the giant warming up for Wigan just outside their box? Hope he's not a defender or maybe hope he is so we can't play long ball
Despite how cold it is love a Monday night game in winter. Atmosphere is usually cracking.
On the way to the game and its a little nippy
Follow that with the snow and I can see this is going to be a cold, eventful day

Cats are as bad as bloody kids. Poorly cat has the shits and has had me awake since 5am grrrr
@nufcstars bit early ;)
@chunkymark that would suggest the government could be trusted to run the banks correctly and fairly. Ha.
@nufc96 and cabaye out injured leaving us with Bigi and Perch and that's it
RT @StarbucksUK: Times running out! Buy a £10 Starbucks Card eGift for only £5@LivingSocialUK  http://t.co/MzJR1UTY Available while stocks last #TisTheSeason
@ChrisSteele90 I have virgin lol I've found it though ta
@Henry_Boxer @attimes haha I remember those times, don't miss having to clear up after him :)
@PardsBoys Man U Blackburn Sunderland and us is all I know of
@ChrisSteele90 where??
RT @rachael_fearon: Now you lovely twitter people, it's Saturday night. Go get drunk. Dance. Chill out. Stop talking about tattoos and footballers.
@nufc96 wouldn't say no to a short term loan deal helps both parties out.
RT @NUFCThreatLevel: Very similar to Warren Barton. He got loads of stick.. All forgotten now. He's got a Twitter account.
@This_Is_Penny yeah he's bit exactly set up for the game, but then I don't know how others have prepared they don't tell everyone on here
@LilYorkshirePud haha he can if he wants, I don't earn enough to be offended by twitter :)
At the same time I don't understand all the abuse Danny simpson gets from his own fans, seems daft.
To be fair to the person who tweeted Danny Simpson about the tat, she had a good point. A tattoo 2 days before a match doesn't seem clever.
@steph_NUFC get yourself a Newcastle one if they still do them, that cheap chocolate which is really nice haha
@steph_NUFC what is it with all you people without advent calendars I'm an old fart but still got one :)
@binzypinzy made my girlfriend this one, only christmas photo we had of the cat but she liked it haha http://t.co/y5p1q9DF
@binzypinzy your never to old for an advent calendar are you??
@nufc96 could really do with him back in January/February
@Danielle92_ yep cause they love twitter so much. Think the child should be taken off her myself
@Danielle92_ your not that woman who's named her new child hashtag are you?
@SteTough oh I know, they've plenty of mine off that competition haha
RT @BBCSport: The first player to score a competitive goal at the new Wembley Stadium, Mitchell Cole, has died aged 27 the Football League has said
@SteTough can't you enter on the website for free?
@skytyneandwear good job they're singing, think my festive singing would scare people away!
It's beginning to feel a lot like Christmas
Freddie boxed like how I probably would yet somehow won despite being knocked down. I'm younger I'm going for it!

RT @MsiDouglas: 'I've always liked Joe (Cole)... I was interested in (Loic) Remy. Bent is a good player.' Harry Redknapp is back..... #otherteamsplayers
@GeordieK1r5ty why not I seem to be doing every bugger else's
RT @PortsladeTOON: @geordieloon1 @toontastic If we get any more injuries we will need to be the 10th 11th and 12th man (Get your kits ready guy's!!!)
RT @geordieloon1: @PortsladeTOON @toontastic 
Hopefully on monday, Wigan hard side to beat,the fans have to be the twelfth man.!
@PortsladeTOON @geordieloon1 the whole team look delighted that he'd finally got the goal. Lets hope it sparks a change in fortunes
@PortsladeTOON @geordieloon1 so I'm certain things will turn around. Hopefully we can keep an 11 fit and push on with those
@PortsladeTOON @geordieloon1 I'd read something the other day that this is the first time pards has lost 2+ on the bounce for Newcastle

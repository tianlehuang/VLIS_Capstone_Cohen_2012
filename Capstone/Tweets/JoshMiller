I am seriously considering boycotting The Hobbit over this stupid 3 movies crap.

I liked a @YouTube video from @djomnimaga http://t.co/3wpA4LxM Portal on a TI calculator! (new video)
http://t.co/7jfxaKxu This is an old Reddit but wow, thoae comments.
The small thumbnails on top of the larger version of the same thumbnail is awful as well.
I really hate the Google Plus Mobile app.  I can't tell what is text and what is a video for starters.
@Slipgate0 What I can tell from 5 min with the Beta, instead of Midi, its MP3. Not clear yet if Animated.Gif can be replaced with Youtube.
I sure hopw the new MySpace design supports animated gifs and embedded midi.

I hate how I feel obligated to spend an extra 8 dollars so I can avoid 3 dollars in shipping #amazon
Oh hey Amazon has a small Anime sale, not that there are more than 3 shows I would want to ow.... Oh hey, FLCL Blu Ray...
@TheZizzler Of the five, I have found Blast Off seems to be the best all around toy.
Oh cool, I have a package from BBTS waiting for me at home.
Met wife and daughter for lunch at iHop.  The placemat said "Draw something solar powered!". I drew a solar powered sun destroying laser.
Yeah, No Zynga, I do not trust you not to spam my contacts behind my back enough to update Words With Friends to allow SMS access.
On a whim I did a system update on my phone.  Its downloading something... Now I am worried...
Vehicons... http://t.co/2AtCUugW
@BWTF_Ben Hmm, I picked him up real quick and it doesn't seem as bad as I remember.
@BWTF_Ben I think mostly it just needed to be less wide.
@BWTF_Ben My main beef with Vortex is the Skirt thing seems to get in the way and be useless in every mode.
Guess I need to slow down.  Skydrive says "This file cannot be uploaded, you can only upload 1000 files at a time".
This is why I have and always will run my own blog/site.  I pay for hosting but I also always own my stuff.
Facebook has some aort of policy change and people are commenting repeatedly about claiming copyright to their stuff.
Before I was low level and weak, so I might fight the PVPer attacking NPCs, but could never fight back.
I love being higher level in WoW.  Now when it says "XXX is under attack", I can actually go kill some Alliance dude.
I unlocked 2 World of Warcraft achievements in World of Warcraft! http://t.co/G7spvn0K
@jzeitler Reports say no available yet.
@NurseMidnight ok.  I have never ordered these aort of things so I don't have any idea where to get them.
Anyone know if you can pre order Figuarts Sailor Moon anywhere?
EA wants $80 for the new Simcity.  Is this some sort of joke?  Also keep in mind it's EA so it will be loaded woth $60 DLC packs.
My Transition to Skydrive as a backup is going wonderfully.  At this rate, I'll definitely be shifting my Carbonite Funds to Microsoft.
O here's a test... will this Canon software be smart enough to find the WiFi printer, over the LAN, on my desktop. IE Wired via WiFi
Wow, Amazon's Video Game Goldbox deals... Half of them are Zumba games.
Played World of Warcraft (PC) and 1 other game in the last 24 hours. http://t.co/Charwhx3
I need to make Noodle On! my new catch phrase. http://t.co/1CKJkhQC
@GogDog Look, all I know is if you compare Animated Lockdown and Classics BB, they are different sizes. so Hasbro is screwing us.
I like how Nike took something McDonalds used to give away (pedometers) and is trying to turn it into a hundred dollar product.
I don't understand why there are any FPS games on Steam's Big Picture Controller Friendly sale.
RT @jaygarmon: LEGO Produces Discontinued Set So Boy Who Saved Up For 2 Years Wouldn’t Be Disappointed http://t.co/pDWRo9xi
@OAFE Indeed.  I still want Roadbuster too, I will have to get a second of one so I can have All Swindle Bruticus.

They had the other four but I onky want Yellow Swibdle, some poor person is going to be missing a leg :(
At Kmart, and I love that card art.  Also only $13 still. http://t.co/waMUXoaQ
@Nintendo_Legend Part of that is paraphrasing but the phrase "keep him from taking my penis away" was used.  Its some older guy too.
Herp, this guy on People's court.  "I was blocking the dog with my hand, he bit my hand, I wanted to keep him from taking my penis away"
Its doing a self check, HOPEGULLY IT BOOTS.
Ugh, I love coming into work to a BSoD on my PC.  Last tine this happened IT had to reimage my machine...

@Slipgate0 No, its the Classics update of Octane.  It kind of looks like crap in all three modes.

I think my cat is trying to seduce me...
@WAGSocialCare I'm good, I was mostly making a joke involving your automated system.
Hey Walgreens Rx by Phone, how can I pick up a prescription at 2am when the store is closed.
I really love when used book stores permenantly mar the inside cover with a price/stamp.  Like I might not want to resell it again...

http://t.co/S9nOjIe9  Like a Boss!
I want to give a good shout out to Microsoft's Screwgle campaign.  The obvious alternate spelling of Scroogle, goes to a Camwhore site...
This is why I have this mold 3 times.  I love this tank.  Its probably the best Tank Transformer ever. http://t.co/42Go9rIN

I really like this toy... http://t.co/xlVETht9
@ShadowbreakerX Rumble is nice.  I think he is the only figure I have gotten at the new higher pricing.
I passes on Prime Kuo again though I really want him.  That $16 pricetag is hard to swallow.
@Nintendo_Legend Yeah, same old stuff.
Duke Nukem 3D is Amazon's Free Android App of the Day.
@Nintendo_Legend Been addicted to World of Warcraft.  All of my assumptions about the MMO were both correct and wrong at the same time...
@Nintendo_Legend I used to have a WinAmp plug in for that.
@Protomanx She looks like she is in pain.
@Slipgate0 @jzeitler Poster apparently is not free anymore.
Anyone else having issue with the Steam Store?
I finally got Under My Skin, to complete the set :) http://t.co/OvCiFpAN

This newscaster looks like a Blonde Rachel Berry (Glee).  It kind creeps me out for some reason...

@Adam16bit "Handling".
I probably get more enjoyment than I should out of my WoW Werewolf having a doofy top hat.

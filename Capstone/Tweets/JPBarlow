@kiwinerd Which story?
@FelixPosts Bold move, Dude.
Baumgartner hit Mach 1.24 at 824 mph. Kittinger still holds freefall duration record. http://t.co/JJFBGeGB
That's one humungous step for a man, one even bigger leap towards the end of TV. Red Bull made up their own Superbowl.
@hughhefner Doesn't that ever get a little tiresome?
@aschoeke A matter of definition. The ambient air pressure at the jump point was .005 psi. Maybe not a vacuum, but close.

He spins and stabilizes. At 729 mph.
He jumps!
Slide forward into the "rest" position. Ha.

Obama led us out of the 2nd worse mess in American history, and polls are rating Romney higher on "leadership."

I wish we had a presidential candidate who would do as Obama says.

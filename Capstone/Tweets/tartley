@ntoll thx. We got the 'baby bassinet bulkhead seats' upgrade, so all going well thus far.
@MichaelJStump would be delighted to. Thrills me to imagine it. No chance you're in Denver next week then?
@ianozsvald thx, transatlantic, but turns out I already got a new passport I'd forgotten about. Phew. Wife is taking credit.
@jgustak I still have a commit that extracts the last of the cxml stuff out into its own package. Need to merge & push when we land.
@prokopp @jsummerfield Thanks guys! We got the 'baby bassinet seats' free upgrade, 1st come 1st served. Phew.
Packed, passport ok, baby asleep in sling. Minnesota here we come! Yahoo!

@jvangael to be fair the 'one tech company' in question, for all its failings, isn't remotely as consistently abusive of its power as MS was
@hjwp The Righteous Mind purchased, my first ebook purchase, DRM-removal toolchain working, sync to devices is GO. Thanks for the prod.
@MichaelJStump hey! I lived in Denver 5 years. Good times and amazing friends. Actually I'll be there in ten days...
@ChrisDeLeon You bet. Becoming a Dad & a new job have paused game making this year. Yesterday I started remake of tanks from 2600 "Combat"
@nedbat Worse, what's all that implementation detail spewed out by every git command? Successful commands should omit needless output.

@politalkal @boxerpaws60 @gregwhoward @obamafraud2012 That is just silly. There was not a big conspiracy that "stole" the election.
@bayareahausfrau  Not just profit, but profit at expense of consumer health care.
@bayareahausfrau That still may go into effect, but Republicans are surely trying to screw us over for insurance company to profit.
@bayareahausfrau That's when all the exchanges were to be in place as well, so if they were going to gouge you, you'd have more options.
@bayareahausfrau ahhh. That part doesn't take effect until 2014. Then, they can't raise rates more than 10% w/o justification.

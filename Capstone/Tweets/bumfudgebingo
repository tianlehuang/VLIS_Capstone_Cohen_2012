@origami_owl I usually use an electric one these days for convenience, but the stovetop jobbies are much more photogenic. :)
@origami_owl No, but I might have to do one of those! (see earlier reply)

My white hairs are taunting me with their luminescent fuckness.
Mocking me like the world's tiniest Cliff Richard gig.
@boo_bessie Can't retweet that now that your a/c is locked, but would, were I able to. :)
@PoorRobin Yeah. Saw him at the Barbican with the LSO in 05 and felt much the same way. Great loss. Will be sadly missed.

@thepixelmaid *roots through pockets for 20p, comes up short* Arses!
@thepixelmaid You always have to have the last word in an argument!* *yes
@thepixelmaid You smell like the bogs at Charing Cross, but I'M too polite to say so. *morally superior face*
@thepixelmaid So much for solidarity! I'm off down the shelter. It's spam fritters night.
@thepixelmaid You just scratched your arse with that saveloy!......... I'll swap you...the saveloy for my bootgunk.
@thepixelmaid It's your finger that tastes like cheese, you idiot.
@thepixelmaid At least I THINK it's duck. Smells a bit ripe. Here, *proffers laceless boot* stick your tongue in it and see.
@thepixelmaid Nvm. I've just trodden in some confit duck terrine. I'll have that instead. Look for something to scrape it out of the treads.
@thepixelmaid Have I? Ooh quick, root through that dumpster over there for some figs!
@thepixelmaid Alright. It was the bins behind the Berkeley. Still yummers. #binfood.
@thepixelmaid Not impressed by Wareing's beard, then? I've eaten at the Berkeley. Food was lush.
@Oomlaaters Gumball's dad is my favourite TV character. The 'End of the World' episode bit at the self-service tills is classic.

@ReallyMissT Hot bath and a mug of Spanish Chocolate. No bashing of the noggin. Doesn't work.
@ReallyMissT Sorry, what? I think I must have dozed off for a second there. ;)
@ReallyMissT You just had to ruin the perverted meanderings of my febrile imagination, didn't you? Insomniac. Always awake.
@ReallyMissT That's either a very inventively worded euphemism, or an accurate description of a very dull three days indeed.
@ReallyMissT I'm not even going to entertain the idea of asking how.
@ReallyMissT Apply booze liberally until unconsciousness is attained. Repeat as necessary.
@LauraSparling Aww too late. You missed him.
@LauraSparling He's still on. You're missing him! *sniggers*

@JessieStroud Ooh! Lovely stuff. Reminiscent of the dream sequences from Watership Down.
Happy BD @Donna_Gallers. If you don't already, give her a follow. She's currently displaying the legs of a woman ten years her junior. #ff
@ReallyMissT Not. Helping. ;) And lay off the tea before you piss out a kidney. You'll ruin yourself for future gin consumption.
@ReallyMissT Yes. Especially YOU.
You feckers.
Oi! You lot! Stop being witty, erudite and interesting. I'm meant to be catching up with some study after a mammoth bout of procrastination.
@daraobriain Second series confirmed yet? Have enjoyed it immensely thus far.
@LauraSparling I bet you were the one that caught their sleeves alight on the bunsen's at school, weren't you?
@LauraSparling *laughs* I'll not be asking you to relight the pilot the next time the boiler goes out then.
@LauraSparling Yes. But no more slipped discs humping the bloody things about. You could always heat your house with it too.
@LauraSparling You need something like this: http://t.co/Q6jg8qY5
@LauraSparling As you can no doubt tell, the use of gas in the melting of glass is a specialist subject of mine. No charge for the advice.
@LauraSparling Make bigger beads. Or go to B&Q. *shuts up, buggers off*

@thepixelmaid You're after the kiss of fucking life again, aren't you? You really are a desperate saddo, Speccy.
@thepixelmaid You're getting drool all over the rug.
@thepixelmaid There's a bogey under your nail. Gross. You've turned a lovely shade of puce though. Most fetching. *clouts you on the back*
@thepixelmaid That's what they call divine justice, methinks. *fistbumps self*
@thepixelmaid I just found a great photo called 'ugly gay interiors' to reply with, but don't have the balls, so you can have that one. ;)
@thepixelmaid *poses, bottom stuck out, index finger to lips*
@thepixelmaid I think my incontinence panties have melted and fused with my scrotal dangles. Quick, fetch a cabinet scraper. And some ice.
@thepixelmaid Aaaaargh! Aaaaargghh! It burns! It BUUUUURRNNNSSS!* *it's rather arousing.
@thepixelmaid Bugger. *pisses pants* HAHA! Foiled!
@thepixelmaid *remains seated. Has no plans to stir from sofa* Your move, Baden-Powell.
@thepixelmaid *sits. crosses legs at ankles. raises eyebrows at you*
@thepixelmaid Of course. How remiss of me. *tuts and glances skywards*

@jamjar74 Yeah. Saw that. She's pretty talentless in the blowjob department too. Poor cow.
@ReallyMissT I myself am about to have this week's diet cheat and surround a large Laphroaig with my stomachy bits. Chin chin!
@ReallyMissT Booze. Curry. I like the cut of your jib.
@jamjar74 *shudders* Mrs. B watches it. I've never been a fan of the show, but have to leave the room when it's on since she's been on it.

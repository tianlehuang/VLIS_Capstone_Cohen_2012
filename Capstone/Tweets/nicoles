I really appreciate the kayak app for keeping track of all my flight data. It’s invaluable on the day of flight~
Landed in Seattle. Here for just an hour or two~
@tessaquarium thanks~!
@IHazRabies thanks!
@Mrjohnston75 no worries, I've already resigned myself to having an uncomfortably wet four days!
Managed to get entirely soaked in the three blocks between my house and Bart. Whee! Onward, to Vancouver~

@jes5199 @BrodyQat And indeed, that is the only real way to go. To pre-design and spin later on.
@BrodyQat It's increasingly frustrating to see my community blind to what exists and how it works outside of burning man's sphere.
@BrodyQat And I don't want to minimize too strongly the work that you are all doing. However, there *are* more successful art events.
@BrodyQat I appreciate the sentiment for sure!
RT @friscoangelboi: @nicoles Amen! i've said before, and say again i want to see what we can accomplish on a 2year time line instead of a 4-9month one.
@BrodyQat 'twas earlier in the past. In any case, the current process is a crisis-generating machine for those pouring in their heart.
@BrodyQat admittedly, my main issue lies more with the feb1 grant date, which puts groups into incredible binds due to determining $ so late
@BrodyQat the funding partially hinges upon coordination of the theme, so it's not much of a stretch to realize it has significant influence
That said, I’m no longer producing projects that work with burning man, so perhaps my opinion is totally unhelpful.
My sincerest wish to burning man would be to move farther from the four month art-marathon, not closer. The art can be so much better!
The just-announced burning man theme is totally great, but doesn’t announcing a theme so late display a lack of respect to their artists?
@janedavis @sofauxboho @mella Sounds legit. With all the relationship dynamics, seems that group is the proper name anyhow.
@sofauxboho I am impressed that they’ve given people two months total to come up with projects. Shortest ideation cycle yet!
@janedavis @mella best idea ever. So artful!

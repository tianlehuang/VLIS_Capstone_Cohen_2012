@Matt_Burden You would be wise to bring over some of the Chikara folks. They put on an EXCELLENT live performance!
@omar01 Starring that to check out tonight.
@NewMutant High five!
@paleofuture I thought history books stopped around the Vietnam War?
Now to go home and get this shot done, edited, and prints ordered!
@AdamBesenyodi Ew.
Heading to Target to buy the one prop I need for this photo. #thatguy

@gobo Happy birthday!
@NewMutant We totally would! One of my goals is to travel in the next year. Hopefully I can come visit!
@NewMutant Oh man, I can't tell you what a mess that video makes me. Makes you want to pick up ALL THE WEIGHTS RAAAAAAAGHR
@thechrishaley Would they have to remodel it every time someone made a heel turn?
@NewMutant Impossible? I'm sorry, you aren't allowed to use that word. For anything. Ever. http://t.co/SSrflkus
@NewMutant There's plenty more where that came from. I'll send them if I have to!
@NewMutant You must challenge him! http://t.co/d43sQ59c
I will be very sad when I catch up on Nichijou.
@NewMutant Hey Alan... http://t.co/aboDkj6E
@NewMutant Do I need to send you inspirational videos?
@NewMutant You have my sword!
@Sammypumpkin Nooooooooo!
I don't like the look of those clouds... http://t.co/vLZcROhp
@dohmestic She's a tough kid!
@dohmestic Hugs.
@Sammypumpkin Thanks! I'll look them up when I get home tonight.

@dohmestic That sounds like a clean takedown. Are there points in judo? I think you get a point for that.
Also, editing photos.
Pita chips with honey.
@aprilbernphoto That's fair. I guess I'm just used to people not bothering me!
One more from the conservatory. #Chicago http://t.co/4EfOv0pn
@aprilbernphoto I was thinking about the botanic garden, but decided to visit the conservatory!

Reading on the train. http://t.co/TRyGdZeg
Ok, time to get my butt on the train!
@dohmestic Brownies? Or Bronies? There is a slight but crucial difference.
@PoeGhostal That is FANTASTIC.
The only Advent Calendar I need. http://t.co/uziL6IjX
@apelad Even when I wear a cape?
@Sammypumpkin Kick!
@dohmestic Baby is a fine scientist.
@molliewollie Have you tried a neti pot?
@Sammypumpkin Go dance on your bed!
@Sammypumpkin Go to bed!
@Sammypumpkin Not at all! I misunderstood your question. I guess my advice is to do what will make you happy. If you wanna have sex, do it!
@Sammypumpkin Has sleeping with someone ever changed how you feel about them?
@zackkruse OH BOY ARE YOU IN LUCK
There are HOW many Discworld novels? Oh lord, I guess I'd better get started...
@Sammypumpkin He was still an ass, so it was good of you to apologize for him. ;)
@Sammypumpkin He probably thought, "Wow, she's really considerate!" Most people would just call him a bastard and be done with it.
@Sammypumpkin That's so much better than how we insult each other! Ours are usually very short and direct. There's no art to it!
@Sammypumpkin So it's true that the English start every sentence with "I'm sorry"? :)
@Sammypumpkin Hahaha! No worries.
@Sammypumpkin @dohmestic @molliewollie I'll be honest, I've never been shipped before. If anyone needs me, I'll be over here blushing.
@dohmestic @Sammypumpkin I don't understand. Why is cleaning only your job?
It seems my fever is gone? #fingerscrossed
@Vernson Have you seen this one? 90+ minute webinar on color mixing. http://t.co/fS15hzMa
@Vernson Thanks again. They're great background noise while I work!
@Vernson Perfect, thank you!
@Vernson Link, please!
@PoeGhostal The majority of the figures I've bought have come from NECA. Good luck with the dioramas! Take pics when they're up.
@PoeGhostal I agree. I'm transitioning to model kits just to feel a little more accomplished...
@Sammypumpkin Dance party?
@Sammypumpkin You should sleep! Or maybe that's just what I wish I was doing...
@NewMutant Trying not to be.
@Sammypumpkin Oh fun! I'm sitting here with the office bug. #stupidworkisstupid
Can't wait to go home and go to bed. #ugh
@Sammypumpkin Hahaha! I've never heard them described like that!
@Sammypumpkin Weird! Do you have a band name I could look up?
Pillars. #Chicago http://t.co/jqcPNg7K
@Sammypumpkin What's chin rock?
@dohmestic Reread this when she's a teenager.
Stupid office illness.

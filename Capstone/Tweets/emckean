@fehguy @godofbiscuits do you think I can get @casualjim to reprise his Scala/enum rant tomorrow? I'm so sorry I missed it. :-)
.@fheaney I should just ping you at intervals and ask "what new Scritti Politti things should I know about?" Following @rhodri now.
MT @rhodri: One day I hope to use the word "egregious" in a sentence. What word would you like to use but have no idea what it means?
@casualjim: "somebody hit the 'make it work switch' ... it's on your keyboard next to the 'any' key"

@mitchc2 will do, thanks! I will destroy the Gemfile.lock in order to save it.
@mitchc2 one link suggests that there might be some issue with the OSX sqllite gem, but I think it's a dependency of something else
@mitchc2 yep, my Gemfile lock is so committed it's wearing a giant engagement ring and writing Mrs Heroku on folders
@mitchc2 I should also let you know that I only experience two Heroku modes: magically works, and hours of swearing
@mitchc2 more like this one ... http://t.co/w9RN7NaT
@mitchc2 supposedly I am "trying to install in deployment mode after changing my Gemfile" but no amount of bundle install shenanigans helps
@mitchc2 chatterbot is great ... any helpful suggestions for getting it running on Heroku? I am having Gemfile woes. :-(
a typo that is sometimes too apt: "bungle install"

In today's The Brunei Times, a look at the role of the Clinical Psychology Division at Ripas hospital #Brunei http://t.co/syIC28Nx
@ohhellogoodsir Last time I checked it wasn't up yet. Now it is. I am happy with this.
@ohhellogoodsir Ahhh was supposed to watch this! Copy frooommmm?
@teah This is one of the main issues although I would've liked to go to the psychiatry department, they are less open
@teah Lots of factors, 1 being language. Most diagnostic tests are in English, lacks the socio-cultural context for Brunei. Lack of research
@teah ..in terms of methodology. Psychiatry in the country favors medicine rather than therapy.
@teah Doing a piece on the clinical psychology unit, interesting points they made about how far behind the psychiatry department are..
https://t.co/YmyUJ00v uses the slogan "Listen to the youth and you hear the future" which is like "Listen to the sea and you hear water"
there s no '' n cecream.
@Wafirosli You are now just fishing for mentions from HBO!
They said that there was still a stigma attached to psychology but essentially they are there as support, also to lend an ear.
I had such an insightful visit to the Clinical Psychology unit at RIPAS hospital, great work by the team there.
Final bow. SEEDS the Wicked Witch last night at the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports. http://t.co/4OyA0bjJ
Especially when considering they are students that give their free time after school to rehearse.  A true group effort.
On another note, SEEDS the Wicked Witch was astounding, musical theater is complex and hardwork. Performances were nuanced and had depth
@teah I just think this type of regulation opens the door to other types of religious enforcement
@psychobabbler07 Haha, I have a feeling most of your updates from there will be about the weather!
@teah Yes respecting the right of others to celebrate and practice their religion. All shops are closed for Friday prayers.
@nacchho A walker, a glorious walker
Probably going to be brought  up by some ministry but is the country  are we going to pass of Christmas as some secular holiday?
Great efforts have been undertaken to uphold the image of the country as "Negara Zikir", but shops are allowed to play Christmas music
RT @Lazer: 1) Holy crap how can one word mean an entire sentence? 2) Why is Google Translate so excited about it? http://t.co/nxg8CxGS
SEEDS the wicked witch tonight at the Ministry of Culture Youth and Sports, a colossal effort by the society
In a generation to come students in will be comparing @teah http://t.co/Xs02Hi4i to @JinShen1 http://t.co/O5QwKEWz in literary analysis
Undeserving reverence for durian, I'm sure there are other sweeter smelling fruits that deserve some attention.

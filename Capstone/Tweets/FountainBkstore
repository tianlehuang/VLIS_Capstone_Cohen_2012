Thanks! RT @LaDIFF: #Shockoe neighbor @FountainBkstore has exciting news! http://t.co/odwfhiHp #EReaders #HolidayShopping #Indie #Books...
@megwclayton Just a follow up: Bookseller Steve did, in fact, eat all the cookies. No witnesses to the push ups, however. ;)
RT @goodreads: There's a new genre in town! http://t.co/y7MpF55Z Do you read "New Adult" books?
"that shih tzu should be dropkicked" -woman looking at Puppyhood
the alarm next door has been going off for ten minutes, but it's still better than christmas music
@MegWClayton eh, it's just plastic, not heavy enough. maybe i'll tape the lid it to my forehead and do one-handed pushups, instead.
i don't know why i bother continuing to replace the lid on the cookies, because i keep taking it right back off #sisyphus
RT @RebeccaSchinsky: It's Take Your Child to a Bookstore Day, #RVA! The folks @FountainBkstore have gingerbread cookies! And books! Go.
Doors are open, gingerbread cookies are out, Christmas music is on. Bring it, Richmond. BRING IT.
It's Take Your Child to a Bookstore Day! (No, really, it is- http://t.co/fQUnLhu7)

@jvpoore Happy happy joy joy! Yes! That makes me feel better!
@verizonsupport I solved most of the problems myself while on hold. I'd really like to be compensated for the hour and a half I lost.
OK! On to happy things! We have @PeteTheCat Saves Christmas dolls! #petethecatsavestheday http://t.co/wXQeIYes
2/2 And thanks @VerizonSupport for expressing your concerns via Twitter #whichtheydidnot @novelbooks @debTWP @0reader0 @ainefey
OK. I am off the phone. For the record, I figured out most of the problems myself while on hold. @VerizonSupport 1/2
@0reader0 I shudder to think of the other experiences. @VerizonSupport @ainefey I'm being transferred again.
They are all very polite but do not have the tools that they need to provide service. This is a nightmare. @VerizonSupport
Who has now transferred me to another wrong department. #blankstare @VerizonSupport
Aaaaand they transferred me to the wrong department. @VerizonSupport
Getting transferred again. Thanks, @VerizonSupport! 3rd transfer and I still don't have the information I need. #lovely
Now I'm on hold after they transferred me to the wrong dept and I can't access email either now. @VerizonSupport I hear ya @ainefey
Closing in on an hour now and still don't have full account set up with @VerizonSupport . No wonder I give up every time.
I don't have words for the crappiness of @VerizonSupport online. 5 years and my account is still not set up right. #sigh #onhold #again

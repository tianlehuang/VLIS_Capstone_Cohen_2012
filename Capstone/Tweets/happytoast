I can't understand how a pillow set I wanted last week is an "item no longer available" at every retailer. It disappeared from the internet.
RT @amandapalmer: so many people. so much death. the cost of living. may we all enjoy every breath on this unanswerable planet, whatever air we're given.
@mktgirl21 Anything specific you need advice on? I'm pretty sure I can help nowadays :) Come back to Rochester and you can see the house!
@mktgirl21 Well said! Having a house teaches one a lot :)
I didn't think there would be a day where I needed to say "please don't content-aware fill out the cat."
The time to fix and move the Christmas lights on the outdoor shrubs is not likely before turning them off at 1am. It's warmish out though!
I'm thrilled that cover or tribute bands exist when the current bands rarely if ever play anymore because the band members are old :(
@antibob it's so pretty! We put ours out and decorated the past few days. I love having the lights on all day and night :)
I feel fake when I dress for business or parties since I'm happier with paint on my clothes or writing/designing at 2am in my pajamas. :)
This may be petty but I am far less likely to attend events that are more formal dress than wearing jeans and tshirts. I *hate* it so much.
RT @jephjacques: look at me actively attempting to maintain my sleep schedule like a grownup

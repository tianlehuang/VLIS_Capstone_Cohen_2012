@ZipSetGo #TNI A9 gift exchange between the cousins. it may have devolved into a gift *card* exchagne, but still :)
@ZipSetGo #TNI A8 i've never traveled over NYE before, but this year, Vienna!
@WibCar @jkheaton @ZipSetGo alas, i'm afraid if i ever fly long-haul in C i can't back and i'm too poor to travel as much as i do in C! lol
@FrequentFlyerU grrr :(
@FrequentFlyerU @United but at least after a call (on my own dime, including hold), they did manage to reissue, but at no cost
@FrequentFlyerU @United happened on an award tkt i booked through united. schedule changed and they didn't reissue. was freaking out in MAD
@ZipSetGo #TNI A7 magical upgrades on all my 2013 flights?
@ZipSetRachel #TNI A6 i wouldn't mind following a trail through TŸbingen, revisiting all my old haunts! http://t.co/rc9NrXoy
@FrequentFlyerU @united oh that's ridiculous!

@justex07 and then stopped working altogether lol
@justex07 ugh good luck with it. last time (the only time) i rode amtrak with wifi, it was slower than a 9600 baud modem. :(
i'd rather be watching Bauer sucht Frau #bsf

Whoops. I've got on the wrong train again. At least I don't know anyone else on here this time.
If I do die, I'll let you all know...
Forgot to put my ham sandwich in the fridge at work, but I was hungry and have eaten it 6hrs later. Now I'm going to worry all day.

So tired this morning, but @deerhoof were well worth it.
I may freeze to death waiting for this train. "It's how he would've wanted to go: on his way to a @deerhoof concert..."
Very impressed with @TicketWebUK. Tickets hadn't arrived for tonight; with no fuss at all they're going to stick them in the Box Office.
I don't normally have the urge to go back to places I've worked, but the Horniman Museum looks awesome.
I encourage everyone to avoid @CreativeLabs soundcards. Terrible drivers, terrible support, nothing but trouble.
@EloisePenny It's AMAZING.

@chrisjlen Just listened to the first bit on the train - can't wait to hear the full thing once I get to work!
So happy to have my dual monitors back up and running. Windows 8 is great for this setup, too!

@mikeyholt You're doing well in the snooker...
Bluewater's Christmas advert is set to one of the poorest remixes I've ever heard.

Don't shout at the staff, though. I'm sure they're just as irritated at the incompetence of their company as we are.
FFS, @NRE_Southern. Your service is shocking. EVERY train I've been on this week has been delayed.
YEEEEESSS!!! http://t.co/DI3e3StZ
For only the second time this week, I got up on time! Cue train problems to  negate my effort.
@alexiserian I lost my team! Couldn't replace some key members. Was it a good night?
Check out how happy the MWS1A-PRM is: http://t.co/EpO2fuuJ

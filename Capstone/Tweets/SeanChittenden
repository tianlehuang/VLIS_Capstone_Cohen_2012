@markimbriaco @lindvall I love Arista, very bullish on their products. Pleased they’re still dev’ing unlike F10 which is stagnant now.
@markimbriaco @lindvall Oh nice. Yeah, just ran in to a pit where `vrrp-group id != 1` == _all_ switching on CPU, not hardware/CAM. Arista?
@markimbriaco @lindvall ha! `conf t; arp learn-enable; mac-address-table station-move refresh-arp` Force10: Been there,have the tshirt&scars

@freebsdhelp Disabling checksums should be a crime and will offer the user a free `rm -rf /` to the user.
Discouraging to see Apple’s software trend in the wrong direction. Less stable, slower, harder to use, more "integrated," & bloatware (FB).
Using #iTunes 11 since it came out and it’s terrible. Old iTunes wasn’t great, but this is a mess to use. I’d hate to see the unreleased rev

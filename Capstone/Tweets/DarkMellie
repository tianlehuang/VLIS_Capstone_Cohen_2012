Ahhh NBA 2K12, so much fun. Although my Buzzer Beater achievement didn't pop which sucks, likely never will now.
Down by 2 points with 1 second to go in the 4th, I get the ball-in and launch a 3, buzzer sounds, video review by umpire, IT'S GOOD!
@MaryKateClark you do the most awesome retweets, keep it up!
@ErinMarcon @burgerdrome @GamesOnNet it was a really good read, really looking forward to some of the games you listed.
@PalZer0 nah, Far Cry 3 does that WAY better!
Aftermath is the true sequel to my perception of BF2. Chaotic yet tactical infantry action. I so love @EA_DICE right now.
@paulverhoeven @TheVineonline Far Cry 3 is a strong contender but Dark Souls challenged and rewarded me like no other game before it.
They are the maps they should have led with as they truly harmonise with BF's infantry gameplay. It's weird that AK didn't do same for vhcls
Not since Killzone 3's terrifying mid-round Petrusite Drive warm-up have I been so impressed by an FPS map. #Aftermath is excellent.
BF3 Aftermath is the Die Hard of map packs. If you haven't grabbed Premium, at the least you should get this.
Far Cry 3 makes me deeply happy. Oh, and @noreasonspec, the true missing element was GTA:SA's burnt dope crops and whacky CIA-guy
@DaveOshry that's nothing, use SpaceMonger and save 100GB! You can blow me later :D
@bradsprigg that was the genius of it though, my words made you SEE. I'm the first twittartist.
@DarkMellie it's not often that I favourite and reply to my own tweets, but when I do it's because they were fucking awesome.
Wow, latest Far Cry 3 patch ruined my game install. Outstanding. Not GOTY, not with these issues.
Anno 2070 wears Anno 1404 'neath its exo-skeleton like it was sexy lingerie.
@dylanduarte the smile provides cover for my tears.
@noreasonspec mantling, movement and weapon 'feel'. Vehicles are all FC2.
@noreasonspec with a hint of BF3, but yes, you have the essence of it.
@MadeInEssex terribly unfunny on twitter, hilarious on TV. I unfollowed him today too.
Downstairs Xbox almost dead, Aftermath isn't yet available on PC and I need to run a scan to see if I have a virus or my G19 is dying. #win
@BRKeogh or GTA SA style where outposts are under threat (which completely sucked).
@grassisleena and by 'thing' I mean it's totally scummy and I'm ashamed of my 18 year old self.
@grassisleena Mind. Blown. No surprise that as a male I've never looked at it that way but 'kindness in, sex out' is totally a thing!
@Sir_JD are any aussie servers running it?
@Quicksilveraus  http://t.co/0M1KbjpU
I really should update my writing hub with the latest pieces.
Truly the most stunning games 'photographer' that exists - http://t.co/5ip6NArW @deadendthrills t'would be lovely if you did 3840*1200 tho!
RT @edgeonline: Duncan Harris is still playing Space Engine, and boldly going where no procedurally-generated code has existed before: http://t.co/VnMKI1il
Causing both my monitors to switch off is a fairly scary bug #farcry3
Sound, recoil, illusion of weight and the impact of rounds on the enemy. Even the recurve bow feels amazing. Aaaaand it just crashed.
Weapons feel better in FC3 moreso than any other game I've ever played.
@Quicksilveraus mmm baby, that would best my UAZ's three frag grenades then!
Minecraft on the WiiU with inventory and crafting displayed on the tablet #BAM #killerapp
@noreasonspec that last one is especially awesome. Weird that they release a current gen console at the end of the cycle.
@noreasonspec what about it has you so excited?
@Quicksilveraus i am now whitelisted and parked in the middle of the long bridge with a UAZ. Small island, must find Object All next.
@dylanduarte you summed it up beautifully :D
@Doug_Diggler brolen back, wall climb and beats bane. All it needed was Mr Miyagi with his little hand drums.
@Doug_Diggler daniel-san cops a beating, learns how to better himself via obscure methodology, beats bad guy with a crane-kick.
@dylanduarte so very pleased that I'm the one to link you to it... you're about halfway down :) http://t.co/9lCc6g17
@dylanduarte 1st series of Underbelly, brilliant dramatisation of the late 90's Melbourne gang wars. Nice work on the Kotaku nod btw :)
@Doug_Diggler yes! Quite a formulaic film too, reminded me of the original Karate Kid in many ways.
@alexmathewson from which they delete the piracy message!
I bought the box-set ffs, what are these unskippable piracy warnings?
But now I'm even angrier at the shoddy combat and stealth mechanics.
Eight hours in and Assassin's Creed 3 just clicked... it gets harder and harder to refind my rhythm with each new release.
@davidwildgoose if I may, protip 3: No, you cannot take down that tiger with a single clip from your AK.
@Quicksilveraus nightscope AND a vehicle? #nowai
@lauralovescake t'was a great read.
@Quicksilveraus negative, I prefer mid-pack drivers with the potential for greatness.
My two favourite drivers, @kamui_kobayashi and @shanevg9 both not driving next year. I feel utterly bereft :(
@Sir_JD JC2 can be the supportive, Puerto-Rican gay Uncle.
@MikeyField twitter hacked much, Toads?
It's like Far Cry and Far Cry 2 had a baby with Crysis as the surrogate mother #farcry3
@Quicksilveraus yeah, next playtime is Sunday night.
@Quicksilveraus grab far cry 3 and blow out with me, it's glorious.
@Quicksilveraus fear not, I'll transfuse you, I'll transfuse you REAL good.
That scene where the nuke hits and you're crawling, I remember waiting for someone to rescue me and then dying... it was SUCH a revelation.
I'll be playing Far cry 3 for a fair while but once that's done, it's time to replay CoD4.
RT @bairdjulia: "A Perfectly Nice, Well-Intentioned Rant About Hyphens" from @TheAtlanticWire. And by the way, it's Spider-Man. http://t.co/kmfRvbC8
@DaveOshry sweet, that thing looks like an isometric Dark Souls.
Really is a mix of FC1 and FC2 and godDAMN the weapon action is fantastic. What a great feel.
It's 2012, can we please have interactive NPC's that walk at the same pace as the player?
@alexmathewson yep, all good now.
@Makena1981 SLI got it working!
Can watch opening scene, he's a scary dude.
@Makena1981 saw that just seconds ago! DL'd it, doesn't let you do what that post says though, I'm misunderstanding it obviously.
Textures stretch and cut off my sight unless I stare at the ground. Have turned SLI on and messed with options, let's see how I go.
Far Cry 3 seems to be an unplayable turd on my twin 580's. Wat.
@marcus_ivo i did not recognise you today mate, you look like a different man!
@CJS_CD_Keys thanks guys, I've already bought it, big fan of your service.
Far Cry 3 now downloading! You guys have got me pitching a tent for this one.. cannot wait!
@Stepto i thought everything went in Binders now?

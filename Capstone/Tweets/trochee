@damidnara yes indeed! ELK is pretty awesome.
@xek Elliott college fund.
@eldang I prefer the term "magus", thanks
@xek @imtboo knows I would happily have tripled someone else's winnings if this labor could have been easier.
In slightly better "data science dad" news: I won the birthday betting pool AND the baby weight guessing game today. Off by only 1.2 oz.
@wordlust power lifter, if Aliens is any indication
@nein09 @imtboo HA I got numbers wrong in first draft. He's half that size, but has an enormous head.
Had transposed numbers on first post. Nice job data science dad. :-(
Elliott Lemoult-Kahn. 7 pounds, 14 ounces. Born 14:44 12/1/2012. Long, long labor, but we're so, so happy to meet him. http://t.co/D0fBw8yT

Some labor progress, finally, before midnight. Many shouts out for modern medicine. Looks like @imtboo and I'll meet our baby today!
@meehu thanks. Lots of friends & allies showing up for us here & FB.
@dj_kittycat working on it, but first two interventions didn't work.
@meehu we're okay for now. Thanks for the thoughts. Investigating alternate interventions now.
Ugh. 41 hours of contractions in, and docs are saying we "haven't begun labor yet" because dilation not progressing. my brave, brave wife.
@mixosaurus @heatherfro I got all the way THROUGH grad school on that principle
@heatherfro @mixosaurus wow, that takes the "bad ideas" prize for the day
@heatherfro thanks! I am tweetering as a distraction during labor, but corpora-L wankery is almost as good a distraction!
@heatherfro hee hee. *gets popcorn*
Still at hospital, still laboring, after a break for all of us -- including the about-to-be mama -- to sleep. Maybe I meet him today?
@hintikka thanks!
@BrendanAdkins thanks much!
Have been awake since two am with laboring, heroic wife. Now admitted to hospital. Getting early start on sleep dep.

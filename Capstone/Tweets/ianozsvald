Last night in Santiago. Excited to be homeward bound. New life with @fluffyemily in London. Hopefully involving a bit less changeability.
@tomcoady I spent an hour on the phone to BA this morning! No joy sadly.
Denied international flight upgrades despite stack of Avios miles due to complicated BA rule changes. Bah! Will try at airport.
Watching Plan 9 From Outer Space (Emily has Left The Building). 3 mins in the UFO is wobbling on its thread. #poifict

@dmpayton I was reading that an hour ago and focused on the same subthread. Indeed.
Is it just me or is iTunes 11 really ugly?

RT @AP: BREAKING: Manager: Pioneering jazz composer and pianist Dave Brubeck has died.
@jwisser For that, you'd need to have a keyboard (and display, I think?) attached, and after closing it, hit a key to wake it back up.
@jwisser If you have "wake for network access" enabled, I believe so.
@jwisser At the end of the day, retina vs. non-retina is going to be your decision. Nothing else matters as much.
@jwisser Generally, the 15" retina is worth it due to the better GPU, but the 13" is a little slow, so it's less clear.
@jwisser Ah, well, then, it depends on whether you want retina. Both are very light. Retina is a bit sluggish due to GPU.
@jwisser Personally, I'd stick with the 13" MBP (assuming non-retina) for the expandability/repairability and performance.
@jwisser I've used both (assuming non-retina 13"). 11" is smaller, lighter, and slightly higher res. 13" is more expandable and repairable.
@Ubercore I've read about people doing it, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. My bet is that it's only worth it on dedicated hardware.
@erynofwales I love baking bread. When I retire, I'll be a baker.

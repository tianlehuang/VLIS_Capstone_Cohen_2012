@DaSoCalBEAR she meant at the club stripping, I had to call her out on it because that's ridiculous. Lol
@DaSoCalBEAR I had an argument with a stripper my buddy was dating about whether or not you can find a quality woman at a strip club. Lol.
@FatChops51 what I do is either bitch at them over the mic, or just pick the 49'ers and keep changing the uniform till they get mad & leave.

@FatChops51 it's when someone chooses the Browns that you know you're about to get your ass kicked lol.
@FatChops51 the only people I get matched against are 49ers, Texans, Redskins, and sometimes the Patriots.
Same, ~80% of people. #Lames RT @FatChops51: Everybody keeps picking the #49ers in #Madden now... really testing me, you mother fuckers.
RT @neiltyson: After hearing my skepticism of eyewitness testimony, six other jury candidates promptly agreed. And they got sent home too.
RT @neiltyson: Done with Jury Duty. I said I could not convict a person solely on eyewitness testimony. They sent me home. I'm now 0 for 4.
What are we going to say if the Bears D plays as poorly against this crappy Vikqueens O as they did against the Seahawks?
RT @BradBiggs: #Bears WR Brandon Marshall held out of practice but apparently just for rest. He's got "coach's decision" listed.
@onswipe blowwwwws at making mobile sites. #BLOOOOOOOOOOOWS
@dailygalaxy onswipe is THE worst way to have a mobile site. I would love to read your articles, but damn. #CrashyCrap

Can't force-feed the idea that life is all about having kids and starting a family then be mad when they act on it. #DUH
I've said this before, but people who complain about their daughters wanting kids need to count how many baby dolls they prev. bought them.
RT @peggykusinski: Confirmed #Bears CB Jennings shoulder popped out, Dr popped it back in later in training room. He'll try to go at practice & see how it is
Wow Marshall mentions the quarter scale before Lovie RT @ZachZaidman: Brandon Marshall on the past month: "We just had a bad third quarter."

@jp3chi yes, we only need two, the Cardinals is a lock and the Vikings are not a good team.
@jp3chi oh you mean a healthy team will win one. I agree, of the D can play like they were and the OLine blocks lol.
@jp3chi healthy?
@jp3chi @FatChops51 I would honestly like to see Urlacher let go to allow younger players to start developing and save money.
@jp3chi @FatChops51 I hoped a lot of players could come back (Mike Brown) but age and injury is a plague when it's dealing w/top money
@jp3chi do you really think the Bears can win a playoff game with this team? I don't. "Rest of the season" may be an extra 1-2 weeks or more
@jp3chi the flaw was that you cannot infer that I am making one decision based on my thought on an unrelated decision.
@jp3chi ?? No, there's an obvious flaw with that logic. He's been injured past few years, he's a Dino, contract is up, and Bears need money.
?? How do those connect? RT @jp3chi: For those saying Urlacher is done as a Bear, so u saying Bears won't make playoffs now?
RT @Gilbs02: making your own drink now @peanuttillman ?? http://t.co/lxKbnU1n
So Urlacher might be out for the rest of the season? Who thinks Sunday was his last game as a Bear? #Bears

RT @ChrisRongey: If a coin toss decides who gets the ball first in OT, there's no reason both teams shouldn't get an opportunity to score. Major rule flaw.
@Xanthor you too, hopefully next week goes better. Lol.
@Xanthor yeah that was disgusting, can't understand how you don't call a spy more than that when the QB runs for the better part of 100 yrds
RT @djdurkin: huge loss for #bears in terms of playoff seeding. now have lost tiebreakers to #packers and #seahawks.
@BLIZGE horrible Defensive game adjustments.
Well, maybe the defense is too old. Can't play all four quarter consistently without giving up on a shitload of plays.
RT @mullyhanley: Whatever happened to the Bears defense?
FUCK damnit.
@Xanthor that sucks.
Strange that it's the O who saves the game, and the D that loses it.
This D is bad.
FUCK
@Xanthor idiots I guess. Plus everyone is tired.
Good stop, ONE FUCKING MORE DAMNIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT

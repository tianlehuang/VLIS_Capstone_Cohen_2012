@TheHuxCapacitor can I point you at @camfots - he's going to Marshall the troops for cryptcovers
@TheHuxCapacitor sorry I missed yer gig last night. I totally forgot, and no fecker reminded me :-(
RT @Eamonn_Forde: Matey Bloke from Huffington Post interviewing Daniel Glass. At least Spotify pays content providers something #satire
@jonhickman It is touching, Jon. But also depressing. @camfots still has so much to learn. It's like Rainman.
@jonhickman In Bruges is the shizznit. Ace swearing.
@camfots See. This is why they pay you the big bucks.
@sebastianlenton Well, yes.
If Brum council start to maintain the BIRMINGHAM SUPERPRIX flowers as a reminder of past follies, I'll know they've really been listening
@camfots MONORAIL!!!
My suggestion was to use the Brum library ziggurat as the hub, and have cable cars speed people above the city to 4 destinations.
@sebastianlenton Anyway. Do you like *MY* idea
@sebastianlenton ah. I think it's an archived post. Probably why.
In 2009, during the Big City Plan consultation, I jokingly suggested Brum use Cable Cars for public transport. And now: http://t.co/FMsGVa0H
@sebastianlenton Seriously, see the Top O' The World, Ma section of this post http://t.co/Nitt96cQ
@sebastianlenton I'm not joking, right, but that was my idea
@sebastianlenton What Birmingham Cable Car proposal?
@driftingcamera @Nndroid @NiallMDoherty All employed British white dudes as well. There goes the welfare / immigration argument.
Oooh > RT @TheStoolPigeon: My Bloody Valentine announce three UK shows for March 2013: http://t.co/Jhzwh0Te
@ceomattparsons no problem. I'll wait by the entrance.
@MatthewPinfield cheers mate
@ceomattparsons Gimme a shout on 07740358162 when you arrive.
@ceomattparsons Great stuff. Will DM my mobile number in the AM in case of problems. See you then!
@Paul_McGee Thanks Paul
Ah, my mistake.
RT @guardianmusic: @sickmouthy Yeah, that blog coincidentally started a few days after we'd been tweeting lots of mundane muso stories a while ago…

Great idea by @guardian here to collect stories of mundane encounters with Rock Stars http://t.co/mpAid20Y. Oh, hang on...
@ceomattparsons We all good for tomorrow mate?
No #uksnow in Brum. This is like the 1992 Olympics all over again.
@velvet_grooves I had some money on a gift card (from October 2011) so I thought I'd treat myself!
I are listening to this on brand new, triple gatefold vinyl. It's extremely good.  http://t.co/FyDDHYQp
@Eamonn_Forde That could easily have been a quote from one of Duran Duran.
@davidhpwilliams triple vinyl gatefold lushness
@davidhpwilliams aye
@davidhpwilliams Looky! HMV vouchers well spent  http://t.co/kPP4xkMQ
@paulrowland1 It's become the best venue in the city over that last 3 years.
@john_rostron Not personally involved with @hareandhounds, just a punter, but I'm sure they'd like to know you're supporting their fight
@john_rostron I'm sorry to hear that, John
I are Xmas Shopping in the fecking Bullring. I have managed to buy 5 things in 3 hours, and one of those was a Big Mac :(

@pezholio @jonhickman @simonjgray Sutton isn't really Birmingham, is it. Them and Solihull have Brum in a twat headlock.
@solobasssteve I was in there a week or so back, it's impressive. Esp. the live/lecture room. Would make a great venue. @AcademyMS
@jonhickman @simonjgray All 3 of those areas have a grand total of 1 half decent pub between them. You could die of thirst around here.
@jonhickman I live up the road. Stirchley hasn't even sized up the task of jumping the goldfish yet. I'd get in now.
@Eamonn_Forde ACDCSLADEMAZING
>>!! RT @Eamonn_Forde: What I learned this week: after Bon Scott died, AC/DC considered asking Noddy Holder to be their new singer. Amazing.
@Davidbench That's good. Hopefully it won't happen.
@jonhickman That's why we moved to the 'burbs, dude. Stirchley is next on the radar. Hipsters and Tesco  want to colonise it.
@jonhickman Any excuse to have a rant at the council. @daveharte & @editorialgirl rightly point out it is A flat.
I'm off my high horse now and will resume tweeting about pop music, telly and other very important shit.
@editorialgirl @daveharte Cheers for the info. I hope it gets rejected. Not exactly a shortage of flats in Brum.
@daveharte Ah, my mistake. But the outcome is likely to be the same, don't you think? The pub are evidently worried.
It's a familiar story. A destructive cycle of greed, shortsightedness, and amazing stupidity, with @bhamcitycouncil at the helm
When those flats are built the occupiers will complain about the noise from @hareandhounds, and the council will cave in.
This is probably why a developer wants to build flats in Kings Heath, right behind @HareandHounds. But here comes the funny bit...
The irony here is that the quality of live music at @HareandHounds has helped to make Kings Heath a desirable place to live.

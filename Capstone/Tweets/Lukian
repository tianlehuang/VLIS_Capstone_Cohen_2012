@idreamofcodeine you can fix that by getting out instantly on your alarm before you have time to think about it!
@iamdaniela easily fixed with pictures? :3
@iamdaniela you're a hot spring chicken! :D
@RantingPudding well, at least you don't have to listen to him if he's signing the lyrics :P
@tanya2708 buying all the things?
@hopeinhell @bobearth lol what o.O
@hopeinhell good morning! :o)
@leesieoh good work :D
@ThatsSoStacey eh, probably not as bad as a mouth ulcer at the front of your mouth. Mmm salt!
@emlypie depends if it was filmed or not!
@RantingPudding yeah, that is a distinct lack of enough cheese to cover that many crackers!
RT @MissSafeT: “@safety_matters: if this one goes to court ... #healthandsafety http://t.co/0VvdK1bH #fall” oh my that's crazy!
@MissSafeT @safety_matters oh, so that's how I change the light bulbs above the stairs. I've been wondering!
@PurringGirl oh?
RT @littlemisslotus: Yeah. RT @miss_shiny: Actually, that's a fair point Jeebus  http://t.co/2yj037yf

@grassisleena any luck?
@AlexHulett isn't Facebook the greatest!
@Project_628 why did you choose to follow me? =)
@hopeinhell are you more concerned about what happens if you broke up while still at the same job @PatrickVardhan ?
@teenytinymel /)
@hopeinhell @PatrickVardhan and afterwards?
@iamdaniela I never started :3
@Silbena shouldn't be any change unless they are doing weird things. Price rises are usually jan1,with two months notice. Eg Signage changes
RT @burntsugar: XmasGiftsFromCoWorkers.lolz http://t.co/DoBcpywF
@llama_egg that's weird, I've never had an issue with threadless. I try to avoid ordering anything from overseas over Xmas though, gets lost
@melbgirltash data*
@melbgirltash that's what days packs are for?
@iamdaniela *hides*
@demonsaway oh hi!
@Silbena doesn't look like there are ticket price rises this year
@adidaq just started watching season 4, so we don't have that issue
@Kimbasawrus headaches?

@iamdaniela halt! Hammerziet!
@melbgirltash tell them not to bleed on it in the meantime xD
@melbgirltash sweet! :)
So tempted to go buy a whole roast chicken and devour some before bed.
@applejack657 applejack showers? :P
@melbgirltash wash it a few times or bleach that area with a cotton tip?
@Scribble_Dragon cleary waxed! XD (ouch)
@Ginzii I'm so confused
@melbgirltash it's only blood, up to you!
RT @littlemisslotus: So this is @sirfat's birthday cake. Yes, it looks a bit odd. That's because it's meat cake with mashed potato frosting http://t.co/4P35NLv8
@RantingPudding he loved him? :P
@callumchapman awesome, probably!
@Scribble_Dragon shaven preferred? :P
@llama_egg success? :/
@callumchapman awesome =)
@callumchapman it snowed somewhere here, in summer.
@Scribble_Dragon check how much deep sleep you are getting and if it's sound waking you
@_Twertle Haha. What was it?
@Scribble_Dragon considered using an app to record your sleep pattern/noises?
@PanicBuddy @_fathersky_ c drive was cute?
RT @pickle2401: “@thecoolhunter: Forget NYC's high line. In Russia they have a 51m long trampoline through the forest. http://t.co/3LGzVnzU” 

AMAZING!
RT @_Twertle: Don't over-indulge this Christmas...... http://t.co/ry3932mG
@Kimbasawrus go shower for warms, fixes everything!
@Scribble_Dragon during the night? :P or are you snoozing 5-6 times!
@Scribble_Dragon what's waking you?
@leesieoh =)
@hopeinhell Goood morning! :D Not bad. Almost home timeee. How's this overcast Thursday morn treating thee?
@artistiquemeg Why do you deserve the snuggest hugs ever? :D
@artistiquemeg Why are you awake? Why is the sun up? Why are the birds chirping? :3
@sirtessa it likes doing that early in the morning.
Steam is hilarious. Just set it download from "Australia - VIC" and it's downloading from "- NSW". Oh well, at least it's 7x faster.
@adidaq Both may be awoken
@artistiquemeg if I wasn't working, hell yeah! :D
@Debella06 stalking me on twitter? :P
@artistiquemeg nope, we're all vain to an extent
@Tashairina cable is rain affected?
@a_liss_a the faster they get home, the faster work Xmas parties come :P
@artistiquemeg ugh, why do people never consider what their partners want.
@Tashairina what's an astro?
@iamdaniela it'd be a very big one. It might even be a "ferris heels".
Everyone in the world who smells bad keeps sitting in front of me. Have people not heard of downwind? I thought The Lion King taught that.
@leesieoh Mexican?

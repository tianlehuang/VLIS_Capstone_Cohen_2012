@steadycraig I was just thinking about how much I enjoyed your music on the Gethard Show last week.
Just as Hank Williams was whispering sweet nothing's in my ear, a real life rustic cowboy smiled at me. mmmm. Not only in New York.
I'd be fine living in a world where none of my friends from The @ChrisGethard Show pretended to rape or have sex  with each other again.

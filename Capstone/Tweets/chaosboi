@newscomauHQ No media outlets reporting on Arias broadcast re shocking sound? Search twitter 'arias' & 'sound', also 'GO' Facebook page.
@McCabeRadar I think you should search both 'arias' and 'sound' on twitter and see Go's Facebook page. Large number of complaints re sound.
@giglercomm @gochannel @aria_official Who is responsible for the worst audio of Aus TV in 2012? It's a shameful effort on tonight's audio.
@gochannel @aria_official Who is responsible for the worst audio of Australian TV in 2012? It's a shameful effort on tonight's audio.

What's with the shocking broadcast sound mix of the #ARIAS on GO? Another #ninefail Seriously bad for any show, let alone Music awards!
Was #nine expecting the #djredcarpet to be that bad, so decided to broadcast it on Go?

I mean, what's the point of having money if you don't spend some of it on fun stuff?
And yet, whenever I think that, I also start thinking, maybe I'm the one who's not dumb ENOUGH with money.
Man, I love my boyfriend, but he is kind of dumb with money ;_;
Time for some more The Path creepiness! I think I will try Rose tonight.
@synchra WOOOOOOT :D :D :D
Just applied for an Assistant Product Manager position. If I get it, I will be sad, because I won't get to work in QA anymore. ;_; #QA4Lyfe
I have in my head the beginnings of a Minecraft parody of Ne-Yo's "Beautiful Monster". Needless to say, it involves creepers.
@MaybeImALion Damn right it is. Also, have you ever heard of a thing called "moderation"?
The Path is reminding me quite a lot, atmosphere- and pacing-wise, of Rule of Rose.
Time for another chapter of The Path! I think I'll try Robin tonight.
Speaking of menorahs, Chanukah is less than a week away and Safeway still does not have its "obligatory Jew display" up. I am disappoint.
Just cleaned out my menorah while singing  @alyankovic's "My Bologna". M-m-m-my menorah~ o/`
Remember MONTHS ago, when Twinings was giving out free tea samples? Well, MINE FINALLY ARRIVED. \o/
@bradgallaway It's basically the art of @DaveMcKean brought to life. Surreal and gorgeous.
RT @benspants: It's "you('ve) got another think coming," not "thing," and if you try to tell me differently I will fight you.
I think one chapter is enough for tonight, but I look forward to the next time I play. And thoroughly creep myself out.
This is definitely one of those things that is more "experience" than "game", which is very much Not A Bad Thing.
It took me a while to figure out the idiosyncratic way in which the game wants me to interact with it. I'm still not sure I have it right.
Well. I just played the first chapter of The Path. Started with Ruby. I, uh. Um. Ow. I. What? Ow.
RT @AUTOMATEDCROC: Hmm, I want to make a Korean MMO but all I have is this roll of string. I guess that means I'm done with the female armor sets.

"What?! Kids this days.  They don't know how to respect. Tsk tsk." #AdventuresInEngrish
I am trying to memorize the Dragonborn song and now I have it stuck in my head. WHAT HAVE I DONE TO MYSELF
welp. So much for QfG5, at least until the internet magics up a solution to my import problem. ;_;
@RSVance DO EET
...provided I can get it to import my damn character. e_e
And now I get to play the one game in the series that I never got to play before! EEEEEE :D :D :D
And QfG4 done, in spite of a couple nasty bugs that tried to prevent me from finishing the game. Good ol' buggy-ass QfG4. <3
@Chaemera I rarely buy and eat grapefruit, but on the occasions that I do, I always go, "WHY DON'T I HAVE GRAPEFRUIT SPOONS?!"
RT @qikipedia: SNOOZLEDOM n. The state of sleepily nestling-up in bed
@delsheez Especially if they use the flash.
@wyldsmith nooooooooooooo D:
@bradgallaway @ashtonraze Done and done! :D
My phone is literally falling apart. Any recommendations for a new one? Preferably one that isn't ridiculously expensive?
@beatonna AGREE
The one advantage tonight has over Wednesday's shift is that there's a D&D game going on right behind me, so I have extra entertainment. :3
If this was not cutting into my weekend, I would not mind so much.
Welp. MAINTENANCE FOREVER, YET AGAIN
@aniligions O HAI :D
@aniligions Also, awkward question: Where do I know you from? I'm guessing a MU*, given our mutual friends... :|a
@benspants Well, fuck. There goes my non-nightmare-filled sleep. D: D: D:
@aniligions I certainly am! But I'd be happier if crap like that didn't happen in the first place. T_T
Oh yeah, and that long-ass work shift? Started on Wednesday at 10 AM and ended on Thursday at 8 AM.
Another day at work, another act of staggering idiocy by our Project Manager. x_x
RT @qikipedia: Prince Charles's name in the Masaii language is Oloishiru Ingishi, which literally translates as "the one who makes cows cry".
Ew. @psychodonuts' next creation, perhaps? http://t.co/47s5rkzr
@sixside Clothes, mostly.
Watchin' the sun come up at work. Not the most romantic of situations.
This is officially the longest shift I have ever worked. Previous record was 15 hours; this one is looking like it'll be around 20.
It has now been over eight hours since maintenance started. I wanna go home. T_T

I need to find a DVI/HDMI converter cable. Where is best place in Melbourne to get it from?
@HoytsAustralia I can't remember which are Hoyts. I can get to the city, Southland, Victoria Gardens, Jam Factory.
@HoytsAustralia @balkandishlex does Chadstone have it?
Anyone know where in Melbourne they will be showing The Hobbit in 48 fps format?

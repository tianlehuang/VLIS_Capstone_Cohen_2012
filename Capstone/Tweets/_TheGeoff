@icecolbeveridge Wouldn't surprise me, I can't even get EE to stop sending me their own spam. Also, can't remove their FB app, WTF?
@icecolbeveridge Spammers frequently send messages to random phone numbers knowing they'll get the odd hit. Could be more sinister though.
@Avertedvision That's not a slip hazard, that's a low friction azimuth mount...
...except the biologists, psychologists, pharmacologists, neuroscientists... Makes sense if "scientist" only = "theoretical physicist"
@Rosswomensaid @northernPolice Lots of us non-FB users were unable to see it - hows about doing this kind of thing on your websites instead?
@MoAnsar It's up to us to vote for the best among us instead of self-serving political parties. #VoteIndependant
@DavidJ_McCann @edinburghpaper "Edinburgh Airport: We've Got A Bit Of Tarmac Big Enough For Planes To Land On"?
Microsoft open beta testing for Socl, their social network. Front page suggests it's about young female models, cats & american sports.
@redhatman Saw a guy play a harpsichord with lots of (original) "effects pedals", distortion, whammy, all from the 1700's or something silly
@redhatman Holst=Metallica (chunky chords, big intros), Mozart=Maiden (clean, melody driven), Tchaikovsky=Motorhead (pulsating, explosive)
@redhatman Link?  I'd always assumed they were much the same thing with different technology. Sandman on acoustic guitar IS classical.
@redhatman BTW, should point out I can't hit a single note properly in three goes...
@redhatman http://t.co/obvXCQTC Suspect it would work better if the strings were running through amps, but that's Hetfield's failing to me.
@redhatman Ever see this? Classical voice coach analyses metal singers with no previous knowledge of them: http://t.co/hiSQ3GFX interesting.
@redhatman Saw Hetfield performing with Apocalyptica on YouTube last night, he looked really awkward trying sing in acoustic situation.
@redhatman I am a man who walks alone, when I walk in a dark room. #MetalQuotes
@redhatman Ha!  Okay, what do you want to talk about then?
@redhatman If somebody a light year away sends a msg & dies 6 months later, they'd still be "alive" for 6 months after we get msg (our POV)
@redhatman Easy to prove given all light-light geodesics have a spacetime interval of zero.  #DamnLostItAgain
@redhatman Being scared of death is like being scared of the time before you were born. (Granted, screaming terror pre-death not the best)
@Dr_Black Ah - interesting - time to get back to Simon Singh's primer obviously! (Once reviewed The Code Book for a bookshop job interview!)
@BBCscienceClub So did Michaelangelo attend an illegal disection and base a work on the brain? http://t.co/6oATYDQF
@eyeswideshut75 Pretty sure @biggestjourney (http://t.co/zbZVJhqQ) wouldn't object to being used as research/inspiration.
@Dr_Black Odds of that happening are 26^3 = 1 in  17,576? (Assuming it's truly random, not pseudorandom)
RT @DeathStarPR: There is literally no better way to use your time at work than making one of these. #StarWars http://t.co/Bz2QXgjj
If you're offended by the language in the last RT then sorry, but I agree with the strength of the word in this context.
RT @DaftLimmy: We need this cunt's golf course out of Scotland. RT @realDonaldTrump: How could Michael Forbes get Scot of the Year when he lost—badly—to me
@Dr_Black @ThinkOutLoudLtd Totally worth it, great gag :)
#ChildhoodMemories were all synthesised and uploaded to my brain when it was created 18 hours ago. #ProveMeWrong
@digitalkatie @charlie_love It's all about "fear of being sued" trumping "actually teaching kids useful stuff like internet safety".
@oxfordgirl Just the same old thing our species has been doing since we wondered if trees were a good idea. This one is special apparently.
@BigWindies And hey, our dads had gadgets too. Slide rules, Swiss Army Knives, The Newfangled Transistor Radio. Facebook is still stupid tho
@BigWindies I make my living from the pocket calculator programmer's work in my dad's days. My dad taught me to fix cars. Swings/Roundabouts
RT @DaftLimmy: I then feel that I owe it to my son to give him the worst upbringing possible, in the worst area possible, for character building.
@DaftLimmy Did your folks try to bring you up in better circumstance than they had as kids? Sorry, personal Q, but relevant to argument.
RT @DaftLimmy "I don't want to understand, it's shite." - Woop!  We have a winner! Welcome to the rest of your life not caring about it.
RT @TheLaddy: @DaftLimmy you may now be economically middle class but culturally working class. These terms are a bit redundant today.
@DaftLimmy Oh stop thinking so much! You do what you do. Many try similar things, most fail, well done so far. You're you, deal with it! ;)
@DaftLimmy @Iain_Coleman Calling Godwin's Law. Not sure if The Thatcher Corollary exists.
@DaftLimmy No, fuck socialism if you want (ditto conservatism etc), but it shouldn't have anything to do with earnings. #PoliticianMistake
@DaftLimmy Class Traitor: One who realises they want to change class before they realise it doesn't matter.
@DaftLimmy The toffs get Made In Chelsea, we get Rab C.  Which is smarter?
@DaftLimmy It's mostly about gathering material to be used in a later edgy black humour book/play/TV-series/musical about the Reformation.
Turns out Dragons Den pitches involving bullet-proof-jacket investment pitches at gunpoint are also "tantamount to obtaining with menaces".
@robinince They refused to show my old flatmates "£200k for 100% of our patented antidote" pitch. #DragonsDen
@jonathanfost Used to buy it most weeks, read the article, go to website for more, but being forced to subscribe puts me off whole thing :(
@jonathanfost Pity. Advert covers the registration page. Used to be a big NS fan, but I can't be bothered with the website these days.
@ThisGigSucks "Only Americans can be Jedi" - ALEC GUINNESS?!  EWAN MCGREGOR?! I'll give you Fozzie Bear though.
@DeathStarPR  Sorry guys, but if you want prophecy-fulfilling kids to go away you force choke them of the oxygen of publicity. #SoToSpeak
OK, lawyers can write, but they're not allowed to intertwine the Osniverse and Reality(TM) in any way.
Right, that's it, I hereby register the Osniverse (open source universe) - it's all fan-fiction. Rule 1: Respect the canon. R2: No lawyers.
@wilw The fact that we'd prefer Star Wars, Star Trek etc etc owned & written by fans suggests we could use an "open source" SF franchise.
@AlexParkerDC Amazing what a blast of cold air from the north can do. Not surprising, and I'm a AGW type.
@junglejhon If you're into Scottish comedy in particular, try: http://t.co/PYUWFOYx (My old flatmates - Catholic content by a Catholic)
@junglejhon Yeah, there was a punchline missing from that one. Falconhoof is ageing too. Liked Stoner-Charity-Night-Out though.
Found myself watching Newsnight more often because of the good Twitter stream from my followees.  Reverse Internet Watercooler? #newsnight
@junglejhon There's a lot of stuff I've though about briefly myself (eg lampshade sketch - actually done it, it's good), half the charm.
@junglejhon There's shows like The Office which I don't think are funny OR clever, then ones like Limmy where I find it funny or clever.
@junglejhon Ha! Love the idea we can judge our own sense of humours as good or bad - can I have a 12% on the strong side of mediocre SOH?
@junglejhon Very different style of comedy - Python vs Terry & June. Worth taking a punt on odd stuff I reckon, he's got his moments.
Limmy's Show: When I don't get the gag I know it's because he's smarter than me. Or because I'm from Edinburgh originally. Still v funny.
@DaftLimmy I used to run a pub in Edinburgh - we gave non-smoking staff "breath of fresh air breaks", same as the smokers.
Limmy's Show! BBC2 Scotland! Genius!
Apologies for that last one - a cheese/physics gag. You had to be there. And a geek. And have a poor sense of humour.
@jonmbutterworth Quark is the ideal choice for cheese-based food sex. Good on tops and bottoms, smeared up and down, strange but charming...
RT @jimmyb_47: @jonmbutterworth French cheese factory explodes, all that was left was de-brie. #cheesejokes
@biggestjourney That's a little profound in some ways! I prefer facing backwards, but for much more mundane safety reasons.
RT @tejucole: The pope and the royal family dominating the headlines. What is this, 1512? Nonsense.
@thatpebbles @marcuschown That might work if hospital was instructed to treat her as any other patient, but quite the reverse would happen.

@BobBrewin A recent experiment in the UK showed it could be useful, although the one military trained subject didn't get on with it.

@redhatman Many sayings are clearly balls.  See http://t.co/58e7Asaj
@redhatman Ditto parachutes.
@redhatman "Sarge, after I pull the pin on the grenade how long do I have to throw it?", "Rest of your life son, the rest of your life..."
@redhatman Light a man a fire and you keep him warm for a day, light a man ON fire and you keep him warm the rest of his life.
@redhatman Waste of time, you have to teach him to scale it, gut it, cook it...
RT @dodefyvie: Biggest feckin Christmas tree I've ever seen just been delivered to the pear tree....lets hope Michael doesn't try pruning it.....
Thought the van MOT was due this month - turns out it's just the tax, MOT not due until June! #Bonus Still need to do the brakes though.
@cstross Wonder if the political fallout would have curtailed the program in the same way Challenger did?
RT @cstross: What would have happened if a Saturn V (Apollo) rocket exploded on launch? http://t.co/DtV4urif
@AlexParkerDC Also, yes, lots of people who have done without money for a bet, the very poorest, isolated, eccentric etc in current world.
@AlexParkerDC I meant as in "original case" - money is a recent addition to our species. (A sense of value, I'll grant you, may be inherent)
@AlexParkerDC It's trivial to show that humans can survive without money. Many, many examples.
Watching Derren Brown's Gameshow - came in halfway through - he's doing Milgram again?
@redhatman It's not really a solo though - very specifically a team sport. This one is just showing off: http://t.co/189iKzCd
@redhatman STOMP! is just Taiko with enough money to make it look like a huge budget cut.
@redhatman I had a go at Japanese Taiko drumming for an afternoon - great fun, hard work, easy to do badly! Done Well-> http://t.co/189iKzCd
RT @redhatman: Not many people can make a drum solo intersting. This guy does. Don't discount the footwork http://t.co/x2lTxMTw via @captainFritzl
@redhatman How do you know a drummer is at your door? The knocking gets faster and faster... Still pretty damn funky though!
Question for engineering types: Would it be possible to generate power from continental drift? Specifically, can it be "smoothed out"?
The X Files: I Want To Believe is generally pretty crap, Billy Connolly's awesome performance is completely wasted. Brave role to take.
@samgustin @bre Industry doesn't know what's going to hit it. 3D printing will obsolete 90% of crap in shops.
Bored. Any tweeps fancy any of following on xBox? Battlefield 1943 , Battlefield Bad Company 2, Left4Dead 1 or 2.
@RichardWiseman Ho Ho Ho.
I could watch Abrams' Star Trek over and over again, brilliant reboot. Just started, channel 4.
Just saw Sony ad - "Trusted by James Bond"! Ha! It would have to be a fictional character. And one with military level rootkit protection.
@nycsouthpaw @ChuckGrassley Lots of deer accidents on Scottish roads. Almost all because of bad drivers who don't recognise danger spots.
What's it like navigating the Cairngorm plateau in a white-out? Imagine flying through Alps with a speedo, map and stopwatch, & no windows.

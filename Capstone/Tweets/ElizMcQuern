RT @curlycomedy: Permission to reject literature that depicts first humans as white? http://t.co/tPtaKiCr
@curlycomedy Permission granted.
(I sort of felt like @DailyJokeByRanj writing that last joke. Know what I mean, @krissimmons?)
I don't want to rest on my laurels, so after I'm done with them I like to dehydrate them and use them in a mix of poultry seasoning.
@monijoi Girl, you should have come to @ChUComedy last night, @becca_oneal killed. Are you doing comedy again? ::prod::
RT @MrChadBriggs: If I had like 3 crock pots I'd be timin' that shit out, player. Just steady cookin and eatin that slow cooked shit.

A group of ferrets is called a "business." No kidding.
Are any of you guys ferret owners? I am learning about the Dance of Joy for work. Hilarious and adorable. https://t.co/eiado3DA
“@meredithmo: Drunk Man Sings Seal’s “Kiss From a Rose” to a Cat http://t.co/Yq3rJGkS” @KenBarnard? Is that you??

Me: I'm going to cook up that turkey sausage. Bryan: Okay. Me: While watching Bad Girls Club Reunion. Bryan: ...I'm gonna go trim my beard.
.@MsAnneDivina @Snapperpacheco "Reach for the pickles on the top shelf in the kitchen - you just might become one!"
You guys are awesome, you know that?
@juliwithoutane Sweet! Just let me know when you'll be there. :)
@juliwithoutane Come to @ChUComedy any Tues at the Beat Kitchen! (Doors open at 8:45.) Only $5, and AWESOME comedy. I'll buy you a beer. :)
@ahsan Ahsan! How great to see your sweet smiling face again! Hope you had a great time. Come back again any time. :)
RT @dickditka: @ElizMcQuern @thebryanchamp man, there ain't a woman who can deny a good bargain and y'all know I got great bargains on mustache rides
Miss @becca_oneal just slayed at @ChUComedy. Like, piles of dead people stacked up like cordwood.
@MimsyYamaguchi Don't tell her! I love her too much!
DAMNIT I TYPED "AN SPYGLASS."
When I hear the phrase "exploring your body," I see Magellan squinting through an spyglass at the prow of a caravel, sailing into a vagina.
@mikedeancomic @thebryanchamp @dickditka Real jerks = awful. Fake comedic persona jerks =amusing. (And, as we all know, Chris Brown = DICK.)
@IJamEcono I know someone who still has a Juno email address. JUNO.
Guys, don't tell @thebryanchamp, but I might have a little crush on @dickditka. Who knew I liked the jerk type?
@caitlinebergh @comedylawrence She can come down my chimney anyt...oh hell, no, even I can't do that. BUT YES, LOTS OF CANDY LOVE!
The same holds true for hobgoblins, bugaboos, and monkeys-on-backs.
@MortBurke @vickimarquette You mean Scully? Yeah, she's pretty awesome.
RT @allthingsanne: Thrilled to announce the launch of thechicagoans.tv. Real stories from real Chicagoans: now with bonus swears!
Your demons are always scarier when you avert their gaze. Stare them right in the face and tell them you see them for exactly what they are.
@ramsincanon Your thoroughness and dedication to that bit is commendable.
Nice little plug for tonight's @ChUComedy show on the Comedy of Chicago blog: http://t.co/3MoZndXW
My awesome boyfriend, substitute teacher @thebryanchamp is a star of the "Chicagoans" series produced by @allthingsanne http://t.co/AfwUpHlW
Reason #517 being a freelance writer is awesome: getting paid to learn about ferret races.
@jmbaird32 That's four full bags jammed into two humble baskets. The bungee cord is a miracle of modern life.
@sam_ash @ChUComedy @hugcity @DrewFrees BOTHBOTHBOTHBOTHBOTH!
...after the show, stick around to see @CJVLR in the season finale of Comedy Central's Mash Up! It's going to be an incredible night.
2nite @ChUComedy: @katiemcvay @JoeFernandez84 @VoteSimmons Mike Stanley @JasonEarlFolks @CJVLR   +@becca_oneal! $5, 9:30, Beat Kitchen.

@Lindygeek Not bad for a gal who remembers bubble gum rationing during WWII (speaking re:my mom, who's 75). I hope I'm that hip at that age.
@Lindygeek That is adorable!
"Honey Boo Boo represents the decay of Western Civilization," said the guy who wrote "Moves Like Jagger." Oh, the ironing.
@debenham Baby thumb extensions! I totally need some of those! Let me know if you need someone to go in on a gross of them.
I'm a terribly inept cook. True biographical fact, also a convenient source of jokes.
Text from my mom: "I just joined the Elizabeth McQuern I Burned the Bacon Club." Me: "Welcome. It's an esteemed group."
I need to help my mom turn off autocorrect on her phone. I texted "love you!" And she texted "Back attachable!"
@evermainard It's just a matter of time until it lapses into self-consciousness, like some emo teen asshole.
@dantelfer I suspected that "it's HUGE and in a jar in a museum" wouldn't be too convincing.
I think my favorite childhood phrase "garbage juice" was partially inspired by the trash compacter scene in Star Wars, btw. #leiaforever
The peak of hilarity/grossness when I was six years old: "garbage juice." I'd tell people who made me angry they smelled like garbage juice.
“@evermainard: I just became very aware of my hair #imonabus” It's all fun and games until your hair becomes self-aware.
@debenham @dantelfer They sort of resemble the Musinex snotwads. Appealing!
@dantelfer Fun-squasher!!
@RobertBuscemi Or one of those air-filled "dancing" things that flit about in front of car dealerships sometimes, y'know? Same thing. ;)
@saratea There was a great (probably terrible) miniseries about the advice twins some time ago starring Wendie Malick as Ann and Abby.
Rasputin's penis. Google it.
@corrbette Singin' in the Rain, yes. Showgirls, NO. (Maybe they should add that to the recorded announcements.)
.@RobertBuscemi Spiritually, you're a windsock.
RT @joezimmerman: Just had a killer idea for a project but my excitement is overwhelmed by the anticipation of regretting not following through on it.
.@corrbette Pro Tip, Jewel grocery stores: you playing "Singin' in the Rain" just before produce sprayers activate? Kinda cute, actually.
@MimsyYamaguchi "I just like to smile, smiling's my favorite."
RT @MsAnneDivina: Shout out to the guy who changed into shorts on the L.
...Jelly Belly-flavored candy canes.
Everybody ready for dinner? We're having candy canes and pizza. I said CANDY CANES AND PIZZA.
RT @wordscience: today someone googled "i'm going to die alone and get eaten by cats" and that is how she found my blog. that is my legacy.
RT @TheDweck: "Thanks for all the information, Doctor, but we have one question: What's labor?" -William and Kate
Need a model to burn her thumb while wearing a Santa suit & pretending to decorate your house for Christmas? @drunkmonkeyshow is your gal.
@saratea P.S. I think of it as a boring story: fraidy-cat stayed in her hometown until her 30's, then by some miracle actually left. :)
@saratea I used to go to swim meets there when I was a kid!
@saratea I was in my hometown in Indiana until seven years ago, when I finally got the cojones to move up here. Best thing I ever did.
“@jmbaird32: @ElizMcQuern Your tweets make my day, especially this one :)” Thanks! That's really nice to hear.
For some reason, the holiday section at Target REEKS of cinnamon. Like weapons-grade cinnamon. Jesus is the reason that I'm sneezin'.
Buying Christmas crap for a photoshoot. I think it's giving me hives.
@saratea How long have you been in Chicago? And where are you from?
Today is the first day of the rest of your existential crisis.
@saratea Aww, thanks Sara!!
RT @saratea: One of the most open armed & kind people I have met since moving to Chicago is @ElizMcQuern #SAYIN #6amconfessions
@meredithmo Me, too. At least dub an actual rapper, like @missckc.

Using "mack" as a verb really marks me as trying too hard/completely uncool, right? Asking for a friend.
The only way I can get through this is another episode of Basketball Wives. Don't judge. http://t.co/1MLQx7EN
It's weird how much Battlestar Galactica's Resurrection Ship looks like a strip club, with the right focal length. Just shimmering color.
@MatteoLane @puterbaughs @ChUComedy Buhhhh! Well, I'll keep an ear out for the spots you'll be hitting. I believe I owe you a big hug.
Note to self: depressing things are depressing.
@MatteoLane Ohhh, the @puterbaughs are doing a Xmas show at @ChUComedy on the 18th! Maybe you could come to that!
@MatteoLane Matteo! I have to be a jerk tonight and miss Entertaining Julia. I forgot I had a prior (considerably less fun) commitment. :(
Bryan is watching the original pilot of Wonder Woman (starring Cathy Lee Crosby) and it's so offensive it's making me want to smash things.
I admit it. Sometimes I'm envious of people who can afford nice vacations. Someday...
So @thebryanchamp woke up and it turns out he was playing poker on Deep Space Nine during my zombie dream, so he's off the hook.
@LauraHugg Excellent point.
Thank god my mom got an iPhone, how else would we text about our favorite kind of pickles, and whether I'm using the bathmat she gave me?
Five hours of sleep. Thanks a lot, stupid zombie nightmare. Now I feel like hell.
@mordicai DUDE I was reading about those a few weeks ago!
@LauraHugg Sucking someone's...oh, wait. #TerrifyingIfLiteral
@andsheewas Get it, girl! (Sorry for the hackneyed phrase. I watched Toddlers and Tiaras last night.)

Re-reading this from @croakeyblog http://t.co/IF2mlgrH. Brilliant survey of problems and solutions with reporting of #indigenoushealth
@EdwinKruys And to ensure patient safety, prob need a low bar for outcome being "Seek medical advice"
@EdwinKruys HealthDirect is more about increasing points of access to health services for people - which prob increases presentations!
@EdwinKruys Evidence is that it doesn't - but that is probably not what they are for (though not sure MLs/LHDs knows that!)

@Martin_Carr We should take turns and just keep doing them in silly voices
It's at times like this when Max will realise who his friends are. http://t.co/aECjQoja
Who is going to represent Max Clifford and sell his story/pics of him in lingerie for him when he is bailed?
Seems all publicity ISN'T good publicity after all. WHO KNEW?!

@Popjustice @jameelajamil Was her having a wooden leg just urban popbitch myth?
@GizziErskine @jameelajamil @popjustice He kept shouting out "STRICTLY COME SHAGGING!" and thrusting till the front row flooded.
@jameelajamil :( I thought that was done specially for us
@jameelajamil @popjustice amazing.
@jameelajamil Needless to say it was the best gig i've EVER seen. He duetted with himself.
@jameelajamil @popjustice and I went to see him live. Had Manilow glow sticks and watched him dry humping. His support act was Bobby Davro.
@jameelajamil "An Audience With…" only works if it's Lionel Richie or Billy Conolly. They are messing with the rules Jameela.
For those not watching, she is pretending to sing and dance on the Titanic whilst not having it off with David Beckham.
@Popjustice @gracedent Towing the company line since being on ITV1's Greatest Number Ones ever. Got YOUR NUMBER.
I'm not just being grumpy, but what the fuck is this Katharine Jenkins thing on ITV all about?

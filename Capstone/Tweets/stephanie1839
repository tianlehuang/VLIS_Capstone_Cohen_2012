@particle_p He didn't eat it. It was just for me. But I was proud of my rosemary potatoes.
Made delicious meal. Was proud of it. Culinary school roommate says "Oh, that's all?" Ate it sullenly. It was still delicious.
@infinitebuffalo hmmm. Dunno yet. After dinner and such.
@infinitebuffalo What does that mean for going? (Sorry. Car person.)
Thinking about heading to @VerdePGH for #RepealDay. Anyone wanna go?
RT @cleolinda: RT @tokyo_sexwhale: Sorry, I HAVE to tweet this cat photobomb again: http://t.co/F9z79G28 I can't stop looking at it.
I feel like this is an awesome summary of my weekend. @WigleWhiskey @MattressFactory @Wildcardpgh @copcomco @PghPopcornCo
Re: last post, I didn't actually eat cookies Sunday. You know, since I did the @lvpgh Joy of Cookies tour on Saturday and such. *facepalm*
I am currently pretending I didn't eat cookies on Sunday... but it was so worth it! http://t.co/6abw7Ogd
My life is full of other people's snarky one liners today.
@infinitebuffalo agreed. On both counts.
Overheard a woman in the Strip say "We could just slum it and go to Whole Foods."
@spode411 @InfinitiSol Not gonna lie, it took me a minute to figure out what the VS fashion show was. It took a lot less time to ignore it.
@InfinitiSol This is EXACTLY the kind of marketing people need to pay attention to. Awesome. Nicely designed site, btw. @spode411
@DoctorBamboo Really? I clearly need to visit that Giant Eagle.

@BrassyLibrarian @Tiffanysblogs I wish Starbucks delivered, she said as she sat at her desk.

@grilledbroccoli And it's close to Saginaw, so you can call in friends. Not a bad plan. Shame its the only weekend left in Dec I'm not home.
@maureenjohnson Isn't that what makes it a phenomenal cinnamon roll recipe?
Why can't I get into Google Docs? It keeps redirecting me to the University of Akron. Am I missing something?
@grilledbroccoli Best, but not only. I was talking up Atwater's Vanilla Java Porter today, and people were like WHAT IS THIS I MUST HAVE IT.
@grilledbroccoli I'm a beverage snob. Belgium and MI for beer, Bay City, A2, and PGH for coffee, now @WigleWhiskey for stronger stuff...
@grilledbroccoli Ooooh... You'll be a master before you know it. Which reminds me to add @EastEndBrewing to the list.
@grilledbroccoli I am beginning a list of things in Pittsburgh that I want to show you. If it gets too big, you'll have to come back again.
@grilledbroccoli My PGH day: labeling party for craft whiskey and gin, eating Mexican, sampling dry cider. MOVE HERE.
Sleep in, labeling party @WigleWhiskey with awesome folks, dinner at Cantina, and tasting at Arsenal Cider. Today was the bomb diggity.
@BeardAndBlazer @BrassyLibrarian It was fabulous. I had great tour  guides. Pittsburgh gets better every week.
@pandaphi I tell them if they ask. I haven't had a boss ask for my social media credentials yet. I think I might refuse.
@pandaphi Most of my workmates don't have twitter yet, but I try very hard to keep social media and work separate. Most understand.
@pandaphi I keep a couple twitter accounts for precisely that purpose. But I have a policy about blocking bosses that's been helpful.
@gasmaskted Time Lord. And he later told us that he forgot he was 15.
I just scared a 14 year old time lord with OCD.
@BrassyLibrarian Amen. Unless it's practically brand new and likely to go out. Not likely, unless a librarian donated it.
@_steelcityfox This is every nano novel ever written by me. Ever. #nanowrimo
@particle_p I see dumb people. *headdesk*
@peterdawes Let me know what weekend. I may be able to help out on accommodations for you guys, depending on the weekend.
@peterdawes If you ever make it Pittsburgh-way, I'll take you to some of the best coffee places. I've scouted.
@latentexistence @particle_p Solid suggestion. The problem being either buying one or getting arrested for destruction of property.
@peterdawes I know you understand. I am growing poorer by the day, but still splurge on good coffee. It's a problem.
@particle_p @latentexistence This makes me want to punch something.
Because "free" and "coffee" are 2 of my favorite words, just entered a contest for free coffee and a press #baristalab http://t.co/UkcBGx5V
@grilledbroccoli I am delaying all celebrations until you get here. Just an FYI.
RT @AP: BREAKING: UN General Assembly votes to recognize the state of Palestine
Why did I not know @thestephenlynch was on @dveradio this morning? I'm pretty his cousin was my teacher in high school.
@NaNoWordSprints Attropenia. My personal favorite character name EVER.
@particle_p Haha ok, ok. But you really should come to Pittsburgh.
@particle_p I hate to say it, but I was 5 in the 90s. 1993-1994, to be exact. Tea issues. All I'm saying.
@particle_p All I know is when I was 5 and in Boston, they had me throw some fake tea off a boat. And the harbor was brown. Ahem.
@particle_p Because you're in some silly city where they have issues with tea. I prefer having delightful tete a tetes with beer.
I need someone to go to this with me: http://t.co/cuqT7gw9 É
@SecretAgentL Oh wow. I haven't done that yet, but I tend to be the crazy running from my car to the door in shorts.

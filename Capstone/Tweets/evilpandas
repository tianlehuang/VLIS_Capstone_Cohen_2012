@NickHodgeMSFT really it's moved? Yay!!!!!
@JKRLMazur we've got 2 pull outs do far 4 days out...
Seriously do people not realise that it costs money when you RSVP to a wedding and say yes??? #weddingpandamoniumrant
Last shift of work before my wedding oh wow!!! This is getting real!
Damn both homeland and revenge are getting pretty damn good !!!
So does anyone have any idea what izzys reason was to go to the tahs?
Mitchell starc the new no 3 or Ricky's replacement #shameful #ausvsa
So apparently ed Cowan has finally got his cricket aus contract ... Seriously he had to wait this many tests?
Watson gone back to opening it seems #whywarner #ausvsa
Remember people Watson is batting number 3 here, apparently our main chance at getting the runs #NOTBLOODYLIKELY #ausvsa
@thejaffman pushing at it first over? doubtful, most batsmen well openers would have had soft hands. He played in front of his pad.
are you kidding me warner... YOU CALL YOURSELF A TEST BATSMEN #getout #ausvsa
@DanGinnane Now that rushhour is completed for the summer, if I have a sporting celeb that would be happy to do interviews etc who doI talk2

RT @RichieBenaud_: We are proud to have for sale Dean Elgar's new book. Only a pair available world wide so be quick #AUSvSA @GregBaum http://t.co/peWxwey0
http://t.co/JJo3Stb2 This is what we were missing today in the field...
hey Steyne! Leave our flies alone!
@DanGinnane but I like Kerry on @abcgrandstand
RT @DanGinnane: Hey @channel9, please throw bucket loads of money at Kerry O'Keeffe. He can do stints when not on air for ABC. RT if you agree
@NazmusLabs @mcakins thanks

@McAkins thanks... looks like i'll have to upgrade this machine then..
Does anyone know if there is a seperate store for #win8 vs #win8cp?
RT @MKPS001: To the amazing Jacques Kallis, from Australian cricket fans - thanks so much for the memories. #AUSvSA
pretty uninspiring bowling this morning...#ausvsa
RT @CamNotWhite: Let's be honest, South Africa only have really turned up for 1 day of cricket this series, and in yesterday- may have won the series on it.
@bunnies1612 it's currently 35.8 with 70% humidity
@bunnies1612 I'm protesting about pants why I can't wear shorts I just don't understand
So I've got a party that's cocktail wear tonight it's in western Sydney where it has been 39 today it's ties and outdoor
@MitchellGlenn ie katitch ? Just my theory
@MitchellGlenn too big turners well that's my theory, they got more over spin there where those that don't turn too much get bounce and turn
@MitchellGlenn wrong style of spinner though
@MitchellGlenn but the WACA bounces and turns, it's just that people forget that!
@102megan in carlo?
@EssendonBomber @AntKaplan @MKPS001 @Hoerboer No the poms stuffed up as usual. This tropical paradise is meant to be a gaol after all  lol.
@nonsensiblekate why why why would you park your car near park cricket? I used to aim for cars when i played :D
@AntKaplan @MKPS001 @Hoerboer and how they stuffed up when creating the first score boards.
@AntKaplan @MKPS001 @Hoerboer cause the rest of the world is backwards. Simple! It's got to do with scoreboards and
@AntKaplan @MKPS001 @Hoerboer No, she was right the first time, please don't bring your backwards kak here :D
@MKPS001 On top of Steyne?
what a catch by the man in red!!!! #ausvsa
@RavenZech @choc_09 u melted wee???
On the brighter side just bought new $10 sunnies that makes the entire world look orange lol!
Ummm what the hell I check the cricket score and wow!
Hey @cityrail I know you don't get this often but thank you for having air conditioned trains
oh dear! Fractions...Coles style http://t.co/Cpz5Vpjd

@GoodDay_ToYou @mattbunney ha ha ha classic!!!
@RealNickHodge that's not right!!! THINK OF THE CHILDREN !!! We don't need the details !
@bunnies1612 probably but not a massive loss but now it would be the end of play for today
@bunnies1612 no Lyon is great at defence
RT @AndrewMosey: Perhaps channel 9 should broadcast the cricket in HD before banging on about technologies that don't yet exist #AUSvSA #cricket9
Why are we attacking? Pushing hard at the ball?
Well that's random my phone just said insert sim... Bloody iPhone5
@DanGinnane I don't think it will have the tennis ball bounce we are used to though
@mistermouse666 lol me plus that one load of 100 kgs
Carrying 100kgs up 2 flights if stairs was a bitch!
@SuckerForRed @shumpty77 ummm helllo... Thongs!
@bunnies1612 he hasn't been hitting the heights has he..
@mistermouse666 sids said he was ok though..
@housh45 agreed but better help would have been beneficial. We were a bowler short.
@bunnies1612 Sids said he was yesterday though....
Can someone tell me why siddle and hilfy are being rested by these sports scientists? #wearedoingcricketwrong #cricket #ausvsa
@GoodDay_ToYou @mellymoo0710 @AntKaplan Good LORD! WATCH OUT! He is a Sth African Spy!!!!!

@chealsye No fair! I have to wait another six hours to sleep!
“I did write some fiction in a historical text, that nobody has ever found [...] a tiny piece.”  -guest prof confessions in #theoryclass!
Provocative! is the word of the day.
@jonfeng1 Great song! It's based on Book of Dreams, by Reich's son - a very interesting read, although more than a little confusing.
Updating the Wittgenstein presentation for tomorrow. Tremble, #theoryclass!

I recommend you do the same.
Basically, hardware stores are both fun & useful places, and I will enter them and buy whatever I damn well please regardless of my gender.
[The previous tweet was in response to the preceding RT.]
But what if you're a woman? Or do you automatically become a man when you enter a hardware store, only to become downgraded again?
RT @andrewosenga: There are few things more emasculating than choosing a product at the hardware store then realizing its by Martha Stewart.
Join me, comrades, and we will make the same dumb jokes once again! Mind you not that they have ceased to provide amusement. CARRY ON.
@jonfeng1 Do not mock my mild disappointment!
Just tried to make a Wilhelm Reich reference in class. I don't think it worked.
@stegan Recommended Daily Allowances of Resource Description and Access, the new librarian diet: a whole new catalog in just 4 short months!
@mackymoo Just finished a day-long workshop - I think I can do excited!
Okay, I'm almost excited about RDA?
@jonfeng1 Haha. You had me pegged as someone who hadn't heard of sports, didn't you.
@jonfeng1 Pretty much, yeah. I do like football for itself occasionally, though.
@jonfeng1 I follow things with more mild interest than true enthusiasm, I'm afraid.
@jonfeng1 My dad grew up in the area, and his dad was a longtime 'Skins fan. So I didn't really have much of a choice.
@jonfeng1 I'm sorry. But I am rather pleased with the outcome of that game.
@jonfeng1 GLOATING.
@matthew_loftus Excellent.
I learned AACR2 by staring at catalog records, so trying to learn RDA by filling out worksheets doesn't feel right.
@matthew_loftus Christmas in Hollis?
Trying my very first RDA. (First time's a charm? Hopefully?)
@johnxlibris Yes, I'm feeling pretty confident overall :)
@johnxlibris Mostly that I have 3 semesters of school left & can't leave MD yet. If it's somehow still open when I graduate I'll do it!
@ProfessMoravec Haha, thanks. I wish I could do both! I'm having some problems with this project.
@chealsye Me too (from both the researcher and the metadata-er side). This project is giving me a headache.
@johnxlibris Oh how I wish I could apply for that one!
Also, people looking in online archives: do you prefer your archival documents in clusters, or as single listings?
It might actually be less work - less looking for similarities that may or may not actually be there.
But I am not in charge of the project myself, so I would need to make a good case for changing the procedure.
Basically, I am currently uploading groupings of docs, but I think they would work much better described individually.
Archivists & similar folk: do you advocate for describing individual items, or groupings of them? (We're talking digitized documents here.)
Even if you're not a holiday person, it's still nice to read (and occasionally argue with) end of year music lists.
@chealsye Ooh. Those all sound good. I would probably go for Digital Libraries & Copyright Law myself. What're you leaning towards?
Today my household has produced waffles, tacos, kung pao tofu, and garlic bread. Excellent day for food!
@matthew_loftus I was there & I have (very blurry) proof! It was a lovely show. http://t.co/1z6LEdFX
@helgagrace Yes yes!
Time to all of the above simultaneously.
It's five o'clock! Time to go spread baking soda on everything. I mean go to game night. I mean do homework. I mean drink? Who knows.
And now google is trying to correct "humanities" to "amenities." You know what, google, take your spell-checker and shove off.
Going to be having some very strong feelings come January, that's for sure. (Still debating between relief and melancholy, though.)
Those books and I will have known each other for eleven damn years when the last one comes out. I'm having trouble processing it.
Just a reminder: the last Wheel of Time book comes out January 8, 2013. You can preorder it. As far as I can tell it genuinely exists.
If you spend too much time looking up DIY cleaning solutions, you realize that the ultimate answer is not 42, it is baking soda.
Considering staying home from a game night in order to apply caulk to various bathroom fixtures. I do not understand my life one bit.
It is admittedly fun telling non-history/humanities folk that 20 pages long is about standard for a final paper, & watching their reaction.

@jonfeng1 Experience suggests otherwise.
@jonfeng1 Agreed. I suspect it will not improve my typing skills, though.

Maybe I'll try guilt-tripping some patrons into quiet instead.
Getting better at telling people to take their ##$%@&! phone calls outside. (Not actually saying ##$%@&!, of course.)
Okay fine our discovery service actually worked for once. I may end up coming around to it.
@helgagrace I love your links today! (In general too but today especially.) Currently nerding out at the desk.

Oh no, I've become one of those people who subtly fishes for holiday presents online. IGNORE ME.
Almost typed "pints" instead of "prints." Those would be awesome too, though.
Basically if you want to get me gifts this year, any of these prints would be great: http://t.co/EVVsAUBs. #justsaying
You want paper clips? Ask away, gentle patron! They are yours for the taking.
I'm ready this week, though. I found the secret stash of paper clips in the supply closet and have liberally sprinkled them about the desk.
Desk has been open not five minutes and there's the first request for paper clips. Like clockwork, I tell you.
Fitter. Happier. Took all the vitamins. Watered everyone's plants.
Woke up on time. Took vitamins. Ate breakfast and lunch. Had a series of friendly interactions with roommate. Watered the plants.
This has been a very productive morning. I feel like a Radiohead song.
@timdiggerm I know that place! What are you doing there?
Although funny thing, the Boys' page is currently featuring the "Hottest Lego Toys" - half of them are Disney princess sets. So... progress?
Hope ya like babies and sewing, ladies! No building block or action figures for you, ha ha!
Yes, it is every bit as bad as expected. Boys' Toys: http://t.co/eSvhxGky and Girls' Toys: http://t.co/U4UqJKUT.
Just noticed that Amazon has categories for "Boys' Toys" and "Girls' Toys." I'm a little afraid to find out what's in them.
@jennydigiSILS Aah, nice - she's one of my favorite people too! And yes, I did help with some Hughes scanning during winter break one year.
@jennydigiSILS I used to work in that department as a student assistant! Can I ask who you interviewed?
Dangit. I came up with the perfect way to organize my CV last night and now I can't remember it at all.
Someone get me an advent calendar, stat.

Petition for the Atlantic to Never Write Another Article About So-Called Millenials Again.
Now contemplating the nature of beverages, and our human interactions with them. No insight into the universe at large yet, though.
Have switched to tea and am staring down into my mug, bewildered that I actually drink something that looks like this.
I think I'm having an emotional reaction to these sample RDA records. Or maybe I've just had too much coffee.
@mackymoo My feelings exactly!
@alexscat I think maps and twitter, and email in the internetless wastes, would be my three big reasons. Emphasis on the maps :)
@PerformHumanity That would definitely be good for me - if only there was an app available for extra time too, haha!
@BibliosaurusRex Wow, nice! What kind of apps/etc do you use most?
Well, I mean, not redefined. But still!
By the way, retro has been redefined: "The Rise has a retro look that harkens back to old flip phones." [from review: http://t.co/AFkseC2w]
Facing the smartphone horizon. I might end up getting one this winter whether I want to or not. Tell me some good things about smartphones?
I work/study at a school where “Students dressed as terrapins ride around track” is a perfectly normal description for archival photograph.
It strikes me as slightly amusing that our dept. diversity group is not advertising any vegan options for their holiday event.
@matthew_loftus I have heard it (and have sung along from the audience!) but I do not have a recording of it.

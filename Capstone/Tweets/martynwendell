We have received the Canadian. Good work team.
@steveslagg I'm back already and Melanie arrives tomorrow morning early. You lose!
@jleonardbc @steveslagg HAVE ONE ON STEVE I GET IT
@steveslagg where are you and why is your answer to that question going to exclude 'at home in bed'
Air Canada inbound, scramble the welcome wagon. T-minus seven hours to touchdown. Pray for good weather, against TSA tomfoolery. Out
RT @HowlTweeter: night
@jleonardbc Indubitably! "Hey @Iamkelmitchell, my friend Dan and I are big fans. Hope you're doing well!" Let's see if he responds!
I don't believe it! I found Kel! [ [ @Iamkelmitchell ] ] cc: @jleonardbc
RT @jleonardbc: We're getting the band back together! http://t.co/CW2mrAQE @steveslagg
@lyndseygraves So it goes. And hey, if it gets the work done, those fits might be worth deploying tactically. I look forward to more posts.
@jleonardbc @steveslagg this is my favorite thing I've seen all day
@lyndseygraves Hey Lyndsey. Read your article on TC and enjoyed it! I thought writing what you did took real moxie. Props to you for that.
Das Racist is my favorite band that is or refers to a German racist, or that refers to a racist of unknown origin using a German d. article.

Internet and Punishment. A Good Man is Hard to Internet. The Internet Jar. The Internet Adventures of Kavalier and Clay. The Bluest Internet
The Boy in the Internet Pajamas. The Internet is a Lonely Hunter. The Brothers Internet. The Strangernet.
It's best if it matches your life at present. For example: Love in a Time of the Internet, East of Internet, As I Lay Internet.
The game is: literary procrastination. Reconfigure the title of a famous book to be about putting off work—e.g. The Old Man and the Internet
RT @Horse_ebooks: How can you not enjoy
@prodigalsam Let the haters hate! You have one of the most well-defined and consistently enjoyable Twitter personalities out there.
(5) I'm not looking for a philosophical silver bullet here, but I am eager to find a way forward. My hunch is that this could be it.
(4) Thankfully, hope springs eternal. What I've read of _The Beauty of the Infinite_ so far has been, well, exactly on point.
(3) But the fix was temporary. I needed a way to incorporate Chrétien's stunning insights into a systematic picture, and didn't know how.
(2) Last year, thesis research led me to Jean-Louis Chrétien, whose book _The Ark of Speech_ soothed my mind and gave me hope.
(1) Four years ago I fell into thorny questions about violence, language, and theology that I couldn't resolve on my own.
If I destroyed your eyes tonight on US-30, I'm sorry. Furthermore I hope a pal reads my apology aloud to you since you can't see anymore.
I think I zapped the retinas of a group large enough to merit its own US Representative.
Thanks to burned out low beams, I drove to Ohio with highs only. 1 out of every 3 oncoming cars tried to let me know my brights were on.

@whitneycomstock I've attended one called "The Painted Door". But I'm looking too, actually, so let me know if you hear about others.
@karidawson5 @Paul32518314 Thanks for letting me know! I think @NormalTweetGuy might be interested. Also what is your band called?

@marlyyoumans Thankfully, the job's at a law school. I figure I could fit in pretty well among the cardigan'd wonks next time, all bowed up.
@MKaaaaay Haha, read that as "knock 'em... Dead? No don't effing do that". Don't worry, I did not effing do that.
@marlyyoumans I went with the less conspicuous euro tie for today. But in case of a callback, I have the bow tie on deck!
Thanks, well-wishers. My interview went well. I feel especially good the about proforeadgni test.
@steveslagg or a LAN party, judging from what I can see of Bagley's screen
Interview in 1 1/2 hours. Practicing a confident handshake and greeting on my roommate. When he wakes up I hope he'll give me feedback.
Finally learned to tie a bow tie! http://t.co/wH27vKZB
Hey @jleonardbc, have you read the DT Max DFW biography yet, and if so, any thoughts on it? http://t.co/wK0gCQpK
Happy Canadian thanksgiving to Canadians.
@jillklosterman congrats!
Hoping to buy this book, and a couple others, after finding work. Thanks to @wesleyhill for highlighting this review. http://t.co/MW8yRZ8I
@MKaaaaay @notjoshblaney A winking frown! That's probably the most psychologically complicated emoticon of all time!
@marlyyoumans These days, everything is!
Back from an 11:30pm showing of The Shining at a local theater. It's incredible, how many laugh lines a crowd can dig out of that movie.

@bstep13 you should make them instead. something made is always so much more awesome than something bought.
@bstep13 i'm an expat in AUS so xmas is never really "xmas". & i'm about to start living in an empty shell of a bus. so: not so much. you?
remote access to places and histories? yes please. / @blasttheory Blast Theory http://t.co/5m8QKsh1
@JonGardener no spoilers I hope...

@Clare1961 also I have an idea you might be interested in... Can you DM me your email address?
@Clare1961 aha! Yes, we'll my first needs are how to keep cool but I will be thrilled to accept your quilt at whatever time suits you x
FAO anyone who thinks #rbrtOZ isn't an artwork: I'm exploring her context, look, function & audience engagement... http://t.co/lZTL0UXe
@lucitemple crowdsourcing is a very important part of my world these days. It's quite empowering, oddly, asking for help all the time.
@Eelizard wow. Yeah I think this is fun but I'll be ok not doing it every week.
@LeahBarclay no, but I'm not planning on hacking her sound quite yet so she can 'perform' if you want :)
@dananimal no filter, genuine 70s shade! That was dry, had been on a few days. They say it looks darker at night under street lights.
I doubt they'd be able to miss me! RT @stvmayhew: @feesable with that colour and the reverse beeping everyone will know where you are!
@kffg by all means! I do keep wondering what her colours will look like in the desert. It's an important factor :P
@stereopublic good, coz I think we're keeping it :p. ps I keep seeing stereosonic fences in thebarton & thinking 'gosh Jason's done well' !
tools of the trade! #rbrtOZ #busmod http://t.co/W9AtFrLL
@sheseesred not the first, but later I'm sure...
she beeps when reversing! oh lol! #rbrtOZ #busmod
they tested some colour... what do you think? too orangey or just right? #rbrtOZ #busmod http://t.co/ywQFae5y

@lucitemple oh that's crazy smart! what a fabulous suggestion, thanks!
@lucitemple they've spent years in UK removing traveller rights. used to be you could park up quite freely, but "those gypsies are bad" :-(
DAMN STRAIGHT THEY SHOULD! :D QT @lucitemple: @feesable They ought to have special parking permits for people with no fixed address...
I believe this is where the phrase "she'll be right" is used...
small concern is that I'll move into a bus next week that is an empty shell (no mattress/curtains/anything) with nowhere to park. um, yeah..
every time I open my wallet i see my Aussie driving licence & grin. bus went for de-reg this morn & I'm on way for more sanding now, yay!

@dmcconachie test not let obviously
@dmcconachie change it. As usual, can't rely on @Waze to fix something that's been explained 4 times despite saying it has been!
@dmcconachie Visible? No they're just too thick. Why do they let receptionists fix things? I'll let St. Dot and we're gonna have to...
@dmcconachie et al. Perlin: "TTS should now be fully fixed" or WTTE. Can someone clear down and test please? :)
@faitaru Ahahahahahahahaha :-)
#uksnow ME12
@Schofe Snow here too in Sheerness :-)
@KentHighways "De-ice you car"? It's a little 'thick' in Maidstone too I see...
Hehe it's snowing outside http://t.co/LacZwSjp
@faitaru I'm hardly serious. I love dogs! Got a whippet myself, soppy little bugger, love him to bits :-)
Car repairs, fuel, insurance and tax can be offset again Self Employed tax as expenses? WTF!? I am SOOO on that!
@the_spiz That's what I thought. I have to do the NIC myself I think. Will need to ask them about the NIC if they pay it for me.
HMRC even
So @ this agency I'll be self employed. An accountancy firm pays HRMC and collects tax with expenses sheets to offset it. What about NI?
@waze @kpcb Ahh ok. If it's our Q1 vs global SatNavs in the same Q, that's pretty damn impressive! Well, impressive anyway ;)
@faitaru Or leave it to the last minute and tell him Santa and one of his elves shot the dog? ;-)
@waze Quarter for quarter?
@dazzledbydaz BTW like CoD much? ;-)
@dazzledbydaz Modded? What firmware version? #theseareimportantquestionstoprospectivebuyers
@ThreeUK @the_spiz Your made up name is Ellie today? Did you change it from an Indian name then? #threebullshitters #gladIleft
@the_spiz @ThreeUK I find it funny how you expected any different ;-)
@kentpoliceroads Alternatively, police brutality with vodka bottles may also work ;-) OK I'm not serious but still...
@kentpoliceroads Instead of campaigns maybe it should be harsher. Drunk driving = life ban not a stupid few years. #keepbritainsafe
@dazzledbydaz @CostaCoffee Should've asked "do you want some extra cream in your coffee or something?" Would've stopped it
@timbones Ahh I thought it might have been old GPS tracks or something silly. Cheers mate :-)
@timbones Is this ramp meant to be connected? MP popped up there mate https://t.co/ZeDY6Jik :)
@dmcconachie Late I know, but tomorrow can you give this AM a slap? https://t.co/G1l7Gyx5 I mean seriously!? No posts on forum, nothing.
@dmcconachie @dwkni Unlock landmark please someone? https://t.co/3EGdS0Sn
@faitaru Fuck sake. Fine! http://t.co/qH9luCOm
@faitaru Yeah I'll admit it was a bit bland. This one better? :) http://t.co/GnAsK2gR
@faitaru Too Christmassy? http://t.co/g8Gf4raE
@faitaru Heh, I just did it to my twitter avatar :)
@Garfyville Inbred much? What's that plane?....oh wait that's the sun...
@xjoshdenx Well it's still not long is it? My point stands!
@dmcconachie @xjoshdenx Cheers Darren :) Fingers crossed it all works out!
@xjoshdenx But yeah, do I bounce back in a week or two? Abso-fucking-lutely. Dole scum could learn a thing or two... :)
@xjoshdenx Wait until I actually start eh lol ;)
@dmcconachie @Garfyville but the St-blahblah should be fixed. St is apparently positional but I see no evidence (yet).
@dmcconachie @Garfyville lol It's on the forum isn't it? Maybe Perlin inboxed me. Sorry mate. She's not sure when fix went through
@dmcconachie @Garfyville Apparently that was fixed. Have you cleared the tts cache?
@dmcconachie @Garfyville Bugger. Will eave Waze running to download it, not that my phone will connect to PC. Grrrrr! Stupid kernel.
Ok so Windows won't recognise my phone now. Fucking kernel. Can't test the tts stuff :(
@Garfyville Yeah. Testing now. When it downloads I'll let everyone know.
OK so I signed up with this agency. Got the job :-)  They'll call me when I start so will ring them Weds so it looks good.
@Garfyville but I'll test that stuff at home anyways :-)
@Garfyville Had you already driven that road before? Its stored in the tts folder and doesn't get updated, only with s folder wipe.
Umm...I think the dog likes chicken soup. All over his muzzle :-)
@waze @DovoS Sweet! Thanks guys. PhpBB eh? :-)
@Garfyville Should be although Perlin told me it's positional. Still have to test that theory. Will do so tonight :-)
@dwkni Duh? Yup that's me lol :-)
"Interview" at 3pm. More of a sign up to an agency. 60 jobs available in one place. Still recruiting. Picking/packing. Piss easy :)
@waze Forum slow and cannot login to the wiki to edit.
@CathyCmck @MartinSLewis "Wot"?
@dwkni That's what I'm saying. Most of those on the south side are not in the CCZ wtf is he playing at? Preferential routing for himself?
@dwkni Looking here https://t.co/J9OBdvEJ the fucking muppet has done it elsewhere too.
@dwkni Thing is, the locks should have been upped to L4, why has he been able to access? :-s
@dwkni Ok, I have no idea whatsoever. Look like the CCZ has been messed up a bit more than what he's done tbh.https://t.co/sZd36bL7
@dwkni Just gonna look now mate, will report back.
@xjoshdenx CM9? Ha! I'm on 10. #getwiththetimes
Eugh, can't login to the @waze wiki. Some errors connecting to the phpBB database or something. Grr!
@dwkni Hello mate, would you unlock and/or fix the turn restrictions here please for that UR https://t.co/MXN4QDm5 Cheers :D
@dmcconachie Darren please see your DMs ASAP.
@dmcconachie Near Worthing. I fixed the problems but still... it needed fixed.
@dmcconachie Please inform jonnyhuk2 that turns need to be checked. L3 editor should know better. October 8th 2012. Lots of errors!
@kentpoliceroads Unless you do it in a confined area away from the public and near a cliff...
@xjoshdenx You come out of my backside. There, talking to you like shit lol :-)
@kentpoliceroads Got it. It stays there until you find the Tippex. Just kidding :-)
@kentpoliceroads 6 years like a caution, or 12? #guessinghere #neverbeenintrouble
@eudelay Cheers :-)
@xjoshdenx @charleystillz @Jasmineeemay Kebab? #fattyboomboom :)
@faitaru They're probably not the ones who bitch about equal rights though :)
@faitaru Equal workload in manual labour? Hmm..... #notgonnahappen #sorryladies
@eudelay FYI guys I will be pursuing this myself. Just a little information is helpful, and great PR for you guys #nowinnofee #winwin ;)

So yeah I've lost my job. Company lost RM contract. Anything out there? I'll do anything up to sucking off the manager for money! Pmsl
@dazzledbydaz @xjoshdenx Especially those that are thinking by getting rid of someone they could get a permanent job perhaps? #menosilly
@dazzledbydaz @xjoshdenx I'm sure "oh its not working today I'll order a new one" would let anyone in. Remove it!
@dazzledbydaz @xjoshdenx Colleagues no, they're like kids too. Managers, absolutely! Security breach chip or not.
@eudelay Because I know they can probably still try to pull the exceptional circumstances excuse.
@eudelay Now I know from my own aviation research there were no CM clouds or storms that day in the UK at all. Do I have a case?
@eudelay EasyJets excuse at the time was the aircraft coming TO Turkey was hit by lightning so aborted and returned.
@faitaru Grass on the pitch = play ball lmfao! Something like half plus two plus a quarter or something...?
@xjoshdenx @charleystillz @NatalieJackman2 Fuck me it's like school...
@xjoshdenx Yeah, to find a fiver that some twat took from me. Mums interview.

@xjoshdenx That's smart, now anyone can copy the design and walk in the building. You work in a bank, I'd suggest you remove that pic!

@RepPaulRyan If you got one, you should write it down somewhere.
If the @RepPaulRyan doesn't drink the water, its makes the #gollum noise.  #VPdebate
RT @_RepDanGordon: Just had a delightful convo/interview w/ @raincoaster Watching for finished product.... (. ) (. ) <---not #bewbs
.@GregJKrieg In return, Vice President Biden asks to be excused if he accidentally refers to Congressman Ryan as "Pumpkin."
@GreatDismal Not to worry.  It was Barlow's error on a manual retweet that broke the attribution chain.
From the mind of Google: Try an image search for "completely wrong" and see who this phrase best describes.
@6 @MrBeagleman Thought ya'll had better vocabularies. Being the root of scatological, seems impossible Lamo doesn't know scat.
@GregJKrieg Aww...  "Told you my underwear was magic!"  As previous winner, I defer to the other contestants.
@morphizm seems to think Lamo wants to add clarity to discussion. All @6 wants is to be let off the hook for #Manning. @thomas_drake1
As a Judas goat does not "entrap" those who follow it to slaughter, so too did Adrian Lamo "not entrap" #Manning.  @6 @Thomas_Drake1
Lamo's big mistake at 22: fraud and theft from NYT. #Manning's big mistake at 22: Trusting Lamo.  (@6 @leahmcelrath @Thomas_Drake1 )
Instead of defining war crime, Lamo demonstrates his working knowledge of trite. @6 @morphizm @Thomas_Drake1 @JesselynRadack
@6 I see a droll troll making fame and fortune by hanging confidants up to dry, but his conscious bothers him. #Manning @AsherahResearch
@6 You confuse conflict with bad behavior. You begat drama on #Manning for your own gain and screwed US all. @AsherahResearch
Lamo @6 publically regrets screwing over #Manning? "any entity is best-served by cutting out what only begets drama" @AsherahResearch
Best stay inside on the 31st, @JRubinBlogger.  The confusion of people who might look presidential could be devastating. #Halloween

Yes.... Yes. It all makes sense now. :-D http://t.co/woAeQDA6
Just finished reading Jim Butcher's Cold Days. Now starting Jay Kristoff's Stormdancer -- "dieselpunk" in a Samurai setting.

RT @dennya: @garywhitta Tom Chick called it mediocre. That's usually the hallmark of a game that I'll love. #NitpickHellReviews

@healcomm Yes, you can pitch directly to me, and I'll pass it on to the relevant editors. Have you been published elsewhere?
@agent3012 Awesome, thanks!
RT @Disalmanac: UPDATE: President Obama honored Led Zeppelin this week; the GOP complained the president needs to take a harder stance on "Immigrant Song."
That's a lot if bits... http://t.co/lMVNWtfZ
So maybe the universe really isn't a giant computer after all? http://t.co/YE2Dr2ux
Congress needs to reel in the anti-vaccination rhetoric. It's ignorant, stupid and dangerous. http://t.co/aWrq0YMq
@pokesomi It *might* work, but not all BD players will recognize that.
@pokesomi Oh, you author a BD disc. The only way I know of is with something like Adobe Premiere Pro. Probably Final Cut can do it too.
@pokesomi The problem isn't H/W, but software. http://t.co/l3lhVz6t and http://t.co/GWVh2eUV

Someone is making a movie based on the Company of Heroes RTS? With Tom Sizemore and Neal McDonough? Really? http://t.co/Fxq3efVr
If anyone's curious, these are the tools I use when building PCs and in other DIY projects. http://t.co/pOYbrrN0
@RickSamuels Right, no charge. We're off to New Zealand on 12/16 for the holidays. Middle Earth, here we come!
Photographic prep for New Zealand trip: D600, 16-35 f/4, 24-70 f/2.8, 70-300 f/4.5-5.66, Joby mini-tripod, chargers, adapters, SD cards.
@RickSamuels Sensor & shutter mech cleaned by Nikon. Now I need to use it for awhile to see if it's really fixed.
The Humble THQ bundle has brought in $3.25M; THQ stock price jumps. http://t.co/WXerSGpq
@jobney It's on hiatus until I find a new provider.
@evanrsparks @codinghorror Maybe because it's a little bit of gaming history.
@Coreymw I'll bet you don't have as many services running as I do ;-)
You can now play the RTS that defined a genre, Dune II, in a web browser. http://t.co/mianYqO8
@nchan I think the RX1 is kind of a ridiculously priced toy.
@nchan But they include the Capresso FrothPro. So I'll forgive them ;-)
@nchan I think the RX100 is more interesting, and a lot more affordable.
@AleHernandez I woke up in my office and seemed to have lost a half hour. Did something happen?
@TechMonkey74 Probably Apple. They heard I picked up a Nexus 7 instead of an iPad mini.
@Kazzerigian You can clone if you're willing to make the effort to align partitions. http://t.co/NlyG84pU
Pro tip: disable all non-Microsoft services before attempting a Windows 8 update. Win8 Update is even more finicky than Win7 was.
Excuse me for a moment, but a mysterious bright yellow ball has appeared in the sky. I have to go check it out.
@vegjoh Not my system so much, but I recently described a $1,000 gaming PC. http://t.co/TVeY9u6H
@AlexanderJN Yeah, I just put 4 x 8GB modules into my LGA 2011 system. (Only 4 memory sockets in this motherboard.)
@mamac_tech What hardware are you running on? Check your BIOS settings, too. http://t.co/Sb5hkhb3
@mamac_tech Mac or Windows?
Just upgraded from 16 to 32GB in my main system. Now I'll show those virtual machine's who's boss.
While it's not a hurricane by any means, the Western US is in for a long run of heavy rain this winter. http://t.co/ZgYqz6nV
@BradChacos I'm too wedded to a mouse and keyboard, alas.
344 billion tons of ice are melting each year from Greenland and Antactica. That's "billions" with a "B." http://t.co/p9UVY5wA
RT @codinghorror: Touch laptop in Windows 8: loving it. Stupid dumb non touch laptops are dead to me.
Really, Ubisoft, we don't want apologies, just want to play the game. This is why always-connected DRM is a bad idea. http://t.co/rcTdVgNQ
@PhilipFlorio No, sold that several months back and got a D600, which I like much better, mostly because I like the handling.
@Nifticus @Macworld And it's even more blatant in Windows 8.
@Dennis449 I personally like Windows 8. It's faster and snappier (even if you stay in the desktop.) But drivers are still evolving.
@Nifticus @Macworld I'm suggesting that laptops will evolve to be more tablet like, whether they're Macs or Windows based.
Camille Paglia believes "Revenge of the Sith" is the greatest work of art of the last 30 years? #FAIL

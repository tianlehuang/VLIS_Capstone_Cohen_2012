I don't understand why my mom has to go to Macy's literally every single day. Patiently waiting for her in the car...45 mind and counting...
Trying not to freak.  #dofreelancemusiciansgetchristmasbonuses?
That moment in your career where multiple things are coming together but you have to make some big investments in order to move forward :/
RT @QueerVeganFood: Looking for a gift for that vegan in your life? How about a donation in their honor to @FoodisPower?
Um, I don't care how successful your composition career is. Your homophobic/transphobic facebook status just earned you an instant defriend.
@happyherbivore my fav combo is usually black beans, green of the day, veggie of the day, and house salad no dressing w/ pico instead.
@happyherbivore order almost any combo from the "Basics" menu! grain of the day, bean of the day, veggie of the day, brown rice, etc
@WillPrado1 one of them??!  i suppose so :)
I have 3 or 4 different work-related phone calls I'm expecting today (or need to make), and I'm totally stressing.  I HATE phone calls :(
Bad habit #546: hanging up when I'm "over" the conversation, even when the other person is still talking.  I should work on that.
Oh hi again! http://t.co/DweEc56j

@lexoh cajun-stuffed mushrooms, vegetable korma, roasted tomato rice pilaf, blueberry bundt cake, bread pudding, pumpkin pie, sangria,
@lexoh it was so epic, i totally thought of you. DIY tacos w/ all the fixins including her lentil taco meat, quick queso, etc, lemony kale,
@happyherbivore had a party tonight to celebrate her new book release, and she made a ton of recipes from it. wish you coulda gone, @lexoh!

@photolitical yeah yeah i know; that's why i say "get to have."  see, i don't care about lasting relationships; don't you know me?!
@photolitical if i'm #bieber, then that means i get to have dated selena gomez.  that's fine.  i'm also calling dibs on ruby rose though :)
@photolitical huh? no. i wanna BE beiber!
@photolitical then i get dibs on being #bieber.  #idol

Got two of my favorite things in the mail today! 1) my biweekly CSA box, and 2) a postcard from PDP!!!  (@phatryderekpan, thank you!)
@photolitical no to the first question and correct to the second.
being asked out by underage boys makes me feel like a cougar. i'm too young to feel like a cougar. make it stop. or make it girls. #crisis
@phatryderekpan givin' me an afternoon chuckle over here.
@phatryderekpan hahaha!! Well consistency in communication has NEVER been one of my hallmarks!

@etherealelle I relate. Fact: I often forgo social activities in favor of sitting at home alone and stuffing my face in peace ;)
@photolitical ha! After what you emailed me, that was nothin but sunshine and rainbows!
@photolitical it's all about scramble with friends! Does your game require audio?
@photolitical yes, tell me!

The more vehemently I vow to sleep in at all costs (because damn it, my body "needs it), the earlier I wake up. Lets try again. #noonalarm
Why can't my parents just fight about stupid, inconsequential, or remotely cute crap instead of this heavy bullshit?
RT @_INTJTweets: Being an INTJ, we are more than capable of being leaders, but we don't lead unless the current leader is doing something wrong. #INTJ
RT @_INTJTweets: INTJ Thinking - If you don't want to do something, just don't do it. #CommonSense #INTJ

@etherealelle in a way we're saving the world from destruction. That's like, an optimistic thing to say, right? #savingtheworldfromourselves
@etherealelle yes we are. Good thing we're geographically spread out; otherwise, our worlds might implode and form a black hole.
@etherealelle and yep.
@etherealelle yeppers
@etherealelle yep.
@etherealelle let me know if you figure that one out and please share your wise secrets with me.
@MinyoungC well thanks, lady.  you're the true pro though, forreals.  i gotta learn from you ;)
@happyherbivore you'll get a big ole' hug on tuesday :)
@happyherbivore HA!!!!  i'll use all my ESP/force powers to will a similar event with mr. posh.
@happyherbivore It's ok. You're still ALMOST perfect lol.  xoxo, your favorite Herbie with the Kobe Bryant license plate.
@happyherbivore what?! where?! since when? i didn't see any when i went during NBA finals earlier this year!
i would be too if i were that close to those laker girls ;) RT @happyherbivore
I love my life http://t.co/KIYYryJP
@lexoh hahahahah. on another note, i was just telling nic about how awkward it was to be the only crying adults in a theater full of kids.
RT @evanrachelwood: Hey girls, if you are wondering where they hide all the good clothes, check the men's section. Thats where the stash is ;)
@evanrachelwood this is probably really nerdy of me, but if i ever move into a new place anytime soon, i think it might be a necessity...
@MinyoungC you didn't get to see any raw images yet, did you? i'm just thankful my messy mop got all cleaned up!  haha
@KarinnaZ yes, i've heard a lot about that but never gone! which other ones?
@KarinnaZ awesome! What is the place called?
@KarinnaZ overpriced, not always accommodating w/ substitutions, my order is almost always wrong, most things too oily, slow service, etc :/
One of my prouder moments for sure.  http://t.co/p1ThcGdF
@evanrachelwood apparently, this tweet happened a year ago. Did you ever get it? #want http://t.co/H59w2zYN
I'm just not into Cafe Gratitude. At all. #sorry #vegantweet
@MinyoungC pleasure meeting you too! Your photos are gonna be so hot; can't wait ;) good luck with your LA meetings!
Mom: "I tried to wear something a little bit sexy, and I think you should too." Me: "No."
@KatherineParkin ooh! 1) I wore my red peacoat today too 2) Glee's upcoming Xmas episode is called "Glee, Actually" xoxo, your fav Ravenclaw
Just woke up from dreaming I was tightly hugging people in a bed & getting ready to die via tidal wave drowning. BUT I'M AWAKE & ALIVE!
On the real though, it really freaks my mom out/bothers her that after a certain hour every night, I literally stop talking/responding.
Mom: "Why are you so grumpy today?"  Me: "I'm not grumpy; I just don't like talking..."  You'd think she'd know me after all these years!
@MinyoungC hey you!  hehe
buffy night.
So glad I'm back home from that soul-sucking party.  Remind me never to go to parties.

@WassupCheif @Kerryepp Could care less about the insults but using them to counter for lack of intellect when cornered is frustrating
@restoreamerica4 Get the facts before arguing, Pres Obama isn't starting taxes, Bush tax cuts expiring which account for part of our debt.
@Kerryepp Using a popular hashtag to make statements and then trying to hide as personal time is more proof of your dishonestly or stupidity
@Kerryepp I was only addressing your ad absurdum attack when faced with opposition. No need for you to speak for others. look up ad aburdum
@Kerryepp And to make ridiculous claims like your last tweet is even more proof of your immaturity.
@Kerryepp Ascribing the mortgage crises to our current Pres is just more proof of your low information about the our economy.
@Kerryepp I seriously doubt you know anything about politics or economics. Not pinning you to a political party as to not disrespect them
@Kerryepp 2010 to now it's stabilized and slowly dropping.
@Kerryepp The graph shoots up between 2008 and 2009 to reflect the market crash from junk dirivtives
@Kerryepp Maybe you don't know how to read a graph?
@Kerryepp Be angry all you want but don't start to lie about facts.
@Kerryepp Unemployment is still too high but still have small gains in jobs over the past 4 years since POTUS took action.
@Kerryepp majority of job loss happened before the Rec Act and since then economy has slowly recovered so you are in an information bubble
@Kerryepp You mean You Don't remember what the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act did to stop our economy from contracting?
@mtgrove Wow, it's stunning that you think I was attacking Romney.
@mtgrove Biden before VP had a net worth lower then other reps while Romney still is one of the richest. The contrast is real #my2k
@_AlanDobson Because raising rate for top 10% would eliminate 1 trillion from deficit in POTUS final term. Why do you ignore facts?
The very action of Norquist telling #Boehner to use debt ceiling as leverage might cost another downgrade. #Norquist is economy killer #p2
@Kerryepp Plus if you really were concerned about the root cause of recession you'd know POTUS was the one who stopped the hemorrhaging
@Kerryepp If someone is jobless then injecting them into an argument about taxing income is kinda silly.
@_AlanDobson Wanting to have a lower tax rate because you make more money isn't really a compelling reason put forth by the top 10% #My2k
@Kbarmike I guess that would be a fun job now that I think of it.
@Kbarmike If you believe that about the President then you should doubt the quality of your sources.
@_AlanDobson Do you also acknowledge staking your point on that is thin and doesn't make sense in an argument about tax rates?
@Kbarmike No one lied. You're just a crazed carnival barker who puts party of country.
@_AlanDobson It doesn't matter if they make more. They pay a lower percentage in taxes then you or I, that's the point you clearly avoid.
Maybe we need to let the tax cuts expire. I'm almost willing to pay an additional #my2k to not spend another moment arguing.
@Camelot1963 good night
@Camelot1963 And that argument is used way too much against liberals and the left for you to just mean non workers who dont want to work.
@Camelot1963 When you say ppl who never held a job you narrow it down to under 5% which don't even get tax cuts
@Camelot1963 I realize I'm the ass that jumped to name calling, sorry.
@LuminatedSlave My anger caused me to miss that. sorry, just got home from work to this crap twitter fight
@Camelot1963 To even imply that the non working population that accounts for less then 10% is the root of our problems is ridiculous.
@Camelot1963 We do disagree and I grudgingly am sorry for the insults but I'm sick of the ridiculous claims.
@Camelot1963 The majority of people on gov assist are not jobless that's why you are an idiot.
@Camelot1963 Considering majority of the pop including yourself outnumber the non working ppl by over 90% why are you talking smack?
@Kbarmike Unless you're a terrorist why would you use Benghazi as a taunt in a political fight? you're dumb.
RT @TallyAnnaE: #My2K Social Security and Medicare are not Entitlements, they are Earned Benefits. We pay for these programs, they are not negotiable.
@_AlanDobson because the top 10% pay a lower percentage of tax then the rest. Why are you too dumb to understand? #my2k
@Camelot1963 You do realize  calling #my2k tweeters freeloaders is stupid considering we're talking about earned income right?
@respirrave dude, if you don't have a job yet then why are you worried about getting taxed?

Super pretty flick about depression. #solocinemaftw
Where are your parents? Country club, cotillion, something racist. #wallflower
This film should be bad, its made of all the wrong parts. Cliches galore but im supes digging it
Hmm former degrassi actress, Joan Cusack and Hermione? All star cast, I've got big hopes
At local cinema watching late session of perks of being wallflower. I am literally only person here. #winning!

Has anyone else watched "Outcasts" on Netflix (or elsewhere)? If so, were there only eight episodes made, or is that just all on Netflix?
I think that @nedroid might be the funniest person on Twitter.
RT @nedroid: Hi, I'm Guy Fieri, and I wish you all love and joy this holiday season. May your celebrations be money and your new year off the chain

I had the sad realization today that since I sent the iPad off with wifey on her trip, I cannot document the rest of Movember. #bummersville

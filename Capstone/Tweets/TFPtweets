@PerthBreakfast lovely! How long you staying for? Anywhere else on the radar?
@FoodieSpy99 @MMCCchickie mmm, looks fantastic.
@PerthBreakfast great! Food and view both gorgeous!
@ekougi specific dates have changed a few times and keep changing, but definitely first half of the year.
@ekougi ooh, great! @giapo is now on the list for next year's NZ trip.
@theheartoffood I'd just pick the fly out, maybe chuck out the food bits in its immediate landing vicinity. But I'd still eat the rest.

@craighind sorry, badly formed pun. Pun on oui oui, not really saying wee wee. I think we should just kill this now :P
@craighind wee wee not oui oui. Pee pee not yes yes.
@RumpelGrapeskin cheers, glad to hear it. :)
@craighind Ya lah, I think you will find "wee wee" means something different in Malaysia!
@craighind keep going with the French! :P

Today at TFP blog: first post of a new series - Food glorious food then twinkling stars! @Flying_Emirates to Dubai http://t.co/yNz4a4AZ
@Leedrick would not surprise me if 'lack of interest' was directly related to the prices @fairfaxtravel
@starryluvly on the list but we've been flat-out lately and finding it hard to dine out :(
@FoodieSpy99 haha! Great, you checked it out! I'm still to find time to eat/drink at all the places there.
@TwitSchtef surprisingly still crunchy on the edges. Eaten cold!
@myffyrigby does it look like this one they had in the UK? http://t.co/VXsvy65l
@foodiecravings I mean I can't comment on whether I personally think it's good value as I don't know all the details
@foodiecravings I don't know the details of how much data you get etc. I don't know if I'd pay for it not knowing details @fairfaxtravel
@foodiecravings it's in the article "Qantas charged between $12.90 and $39.90 for its data packages on board." @fairfaxtravel
@foodiecravings it's like internet access in Aussie hotels - most people would say still too pricey @FairfaxTravel

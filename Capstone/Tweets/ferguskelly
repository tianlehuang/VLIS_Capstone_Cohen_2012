@StanCarey Nah, it's definitely scripted. Has been bugging me for a long time. Common in speech down here. @garathon66 @faduda
@faduda Hmmm. Not convinced. Almost sounds like tos are being subbed out in scripts, to my ear anyways. @stancarey
@StanCarey Was on the news at one on TV. Corrected in later broadcasts
@StanCarey Conscious of it cos I'm from Belfast so the dropping of 'to' at all offends my ears. Have noted it becoming more common on RTE
.@ouramma RT @NoSurrenderLady: NOOOOO SUUURRREEENNNDDDEERRRR
@midweshterner RT @anthonymcg: Hungover Owls? They'd be here: http://t.co/5Svnaeec
@1TomHickey I keep seeing '100 stations closing' not 'almost one sixth of stations closing'.
@feyhops @ncremins MTTF can vary quite significantly. #justsayin
@PMVTrust Hmm. Better to have 100 very engaged followers than 1,000 not so engaged IMO.
@john_mcguirk Build your own? http://t.co/QUhdylh1
@PMVTrust Why are you counting? @donnchanuig
Dropping the word "to" on RTE is increasing. '…after a decision limit flying of flags…' - what does this actually mean? @StanCarey
interesting to note that @labour isn't engaging on here, just broadcasting #budget13
@BlakeCreedon Fab.
RT @BlakeCreedon: Enjoying Dave Brubeck clips last few days but keep coming back to one focused on his drummer http://t.co/DCJzmh2O Joe's alive and well BTW.
RT @namawinelake: Definitely worth a read! The expert report on the property tax is finally published after being with Min Hogan 6 mths http://t.co/9KfWvdma
@peterhick Does that include any VAT? @ireland
RT @peterhick: It now transpires that this new carbon tax will add €2.60 to a bag of coal and 50cent on a bale of briquettes #budget13
This Starbucks decision in the UK is interesting. Wonder if we could exert the same pressure on MNCs here? I'm guessing no …
RT @conor_w_ryan: Ombudsman: "The Minister has continued two schemes in operation in the full knowledge that they are breaching the Equal Status Acts."
RT @conor_w_ryan: Ombudsman: "The decision of the Min for Health to reject my recommendations amounts to an unequivocal statement that the law is optional."
RT @conor_w_ryan: The Ombudsman's has said that Health Minister James Reilly has decided "the law is optional" & he "refuses to accept the law of the land".
@LyraMcKee And BBC
@LyraMcKee ITV have named him
RT @MurphyVincent: WOW ->> RT "@itvnews PR consultant Max Clifford has been arrested by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile abuse allegations"
@faduda Assume we'll eventually see an EU law so.
@faduda In other news, seen this? http://t.co/A6l8kQtc @tupp_ed
@faduda So, in short, I was getting a bit confused! @tupp_ed
@faduda Is @tupp_ed suggesting that the newspaper owning copyright might be unlawful, or am I just getting confused?
@faduda Hmmm. Interesting. I must have lived in a slightly better world so, allowing staff journos to republish
MT @Tupp_Ed: Newspaper Licensing Ireland: 2nd letter for Women’s Aid re paying to link to newspaper websites http://t.co/bso15keo
@Tupp_Ed Interesting. Usually an agreement that copyright of published articles is held by both paper AND author AFAIK. /cc @faduda
@poshknacker_1 Don't forget that this is directed solely at men.
@conor_pope Contents?
@colettebrowne Other than the fact that it's mainly party political point scoring, agreed.
@anniewestdotcom Why?
@jeffjarvis Irish newspapers want the same thing. They're already invoicing charities for linking to their sites http://t.co/rAnJzWtj
@eolai And as for the twite, you've better recall than me!
@eolai I do love a good rant re typefaces! Was talking about gunnera ('wild rhubarb') with friends at Achill-henge last weekend. Again.
@MazzyK Gotcha.
@MazzyK Care to bet on any? ;)
@eolai Also, sad to hear about your studio 'issues'. Also also, how's the book coming? If you ever need a designer …
@alanob2112 But I'm too tired to continue this … @ledroit1
@alanob2112 Again, correlation is not causation. What other factors are being ignored? @ledroit1
@eolai Something's not right here.
@LeDroit1 Possibly ;) Agree that there is a risk, disagree irrefutability. @alanob2112
@alanob2112 'At risk' = 'irrefutable'?
@soundmigration Don't forget about the 23% VAT …
@paulmwatson Badgerless?
.@LeDroit1 @alanob2112 Not convinced that Laffer is irrefutable. Also, indications that max tax take is at 70%, if you're a believer
@alanob2112 Again with the qualifying 'excessive'. Gonna give me a number?
Interesting advert! #WineTax RT @davidcochrane: The front page of Thursday's @IrishTimes http://t.co/ypwo3BYK
@alanob2112 No it's not. It may be argued but it's not irrefutable. It appears to suit your political viewpoint tho ;)
Shurely shome mishtake? RT @eolai: Working on a painting with - controversially - a blue sky.
@alanob2112 Proves nothing. Correlation is not causation.
@philipoconnor Think that that culture has been around a lot longer than that. (over-thated sentence but I'm tired and annoyed)
@cmcgovern *whispers* this is #budget13, Colin. Or are you a regular napper? @colmtobin
@philipoconnor He has a point re tax rates and delivery of services tho. The difference is cultural not economic IMO.
@irish2witter Fools.
@LeDroit1 So the change in November was due to over-taxation since September? Laffer argument? @alanob2112
@alanob2112 There's an assumption there that tax was the cause. What about lack of work? @LeDroit1
@irish2witter For me it was all about power. Some senior figures couldn't see beyond that. We need normal politics here.
RT @colettebrowne: Woman on #vinb points out that Nama spends €60m on external legal fees pa and the budget has allocated it just €10m for social housing.
@paulmwatson Ah. Misunderstood. Rage-filled and not sensible this eve. @mediamurray
@irish2witter And, with normal politics, they would only last a single term and then there'd be change. @labour
@paulmwatson Much more complex issues there, but I get your point. I'm from the enforced-coalition North after all ;~) @mediamurray
@JohnMoynes Not a huge amount of democracy down here either. Vote for a party, they renege on promises …
*deep breaths* *calming down, calming down …*
@mediamurray So don't enter a coalition then. Allow the policies you disagree with to be seen as they are. Only way to change is to change
@tomdoorley Phew! ;)
@mediamurray +++ have real alternatives to the established FF/FG policies. Need a true left-wing voice
@mediamurray It's at this point we'll have to agree to disagree. Ireland's political system needs to change. Only way to do that is to +++
@tomdoorley Disagree, but too annoyed to debate rationally. Will pick this up with you again.
Yes. RT @psychusup: Was Eamon Gilmores thirst for power so great he's willing to lay his party on the sacrificial altar to satan?
@mediamurray No, it's really simple. Forget about power and stick to your core principles.
@tomdoorley Sugar/fat taxes are red herrings
@mediamurray It'll take big changes to even get a preference from me in future elections and I come from a 'red flag'-singing household
@mediamurray Brought it on themselves. Have been saying it since the genius Gilmore got elected leader. All about power now.
@thescore_ie Video's been removed already. @datbeardyman
Sad to say it, but I hope #budget13 destroys @Labour
@FraffieB It's just stupid. Makes such a difference to society there, and to the economy. Our leaders just whinge about the cost.
@FraffieB I have a friend in Copenhagen who was considering returning home. Childcare there made the difference. Angers me.
@FraffieB It's gonna be trialled. Specific areas only. Pilot studies etc. Then ruled out. @labour
@paulmwatson Good luck with figuring that out. It'll be 0.5% very soon tho.
RT @squidlimerick: Maybe we can find someone to turn water into wine.  this is a catholic country after all #budget13
@datbeardyman Tax on 'alternative' religions? ;~) @janeruffino @cmcgovern @am_flynn
@FraffieB Sorry. Sickened, and trying to get through it with a modicum of humour.
@FraffieB And it'll be couched in terms of a jobs stimulus and investment in the real economy no doubt
@FraffieB Which company will be the big winner there I wonder.
@janeruffino @datbeardyman FFS! Help the rest of us shoulder this load! It's only patriotic. @cmcgovern @am_flynn
@FraffieB Hinting at vouchers in the future?
@datbeardyman I read that as 3/4 of the year … @cmcgovern @am_flynn @janeruffino
@cmcgovern I still have an unshakeable nagging doubt
@cmcgovern Super-genius social 'media' management - sure they're famed for it
@CelizMurray Appeals to its ABC1 demographic. @cmcgovern
@cmcgovern Guilty of giving it too much brain space myself. Unusually clever tactic by govt?
RT @AllanCavanagh: The proper time to introduce new taxes is when people have no money. The wrong time is during overheated credit-fuelled booms. #Budget2013
@cmcgovern Wine tax is loud on here. Not sure how universal that is.
@ElaineEdwards I went myself. Shelves almost emptied of the cheap special offer stuff. Understandable with Crimbo coming but still a bit mad
@garethsoye And you only pay property tax on the middle value of that range. €45 I reckon.

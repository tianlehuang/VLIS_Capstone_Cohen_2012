@nixsight course they had to work harder to sell me because the movie's backers are the same ones that adapted Twilight to screen
@nixsight ha! I thought so for a bit. Then I just rolled with it. Course, it might be I like the band they chose.
@nixsight nah. Humans infect zombies(the still fleshy ones) with love.  A definite danger of being sappy,  yes.

@LargeMarge67 yup. Darwin. The guy who should be hard to kill, offed in his first encounter.
@LargeMarge67 lol!
@LargeMarge67 First Class was just fun all around. Except for that Darwin business. Wolvie lacked focus. Maybe I just like Hugh Jackman.
@LargeMarge67 ok. I can't fix the helicopter fight sequence. That'll have to go.
@LargeMarge67 I can deal with the non-canon bits. Of course, it could be the cheap Yeunglings talking. :)
@LargeMarge67 yeah. I've seen all three alternates. I swear there was a good movie in there once.
@LargeMarge67 drop that thing they turned Deadpool into.
@LargeMarge67 drop the Gambit &  Cyke cameos. Maybe include Maverick.
@LargeMarge67 like, the real reason his memory is fucked, she tried to make him forget her but in her pain she made him forget everything.
@LargeMarge67 hey, I mentally re-write the hell outta Wolverine Origins. Though they don't make it easy.
No matter how horrible the movie may be, 80s me is overjoyed at seeing the X-Men universe on the silver screen. #originswolverine

Phew! Have got to admit I had that dreadful feeling we were going to get punished for our wastefulness. FT 1-0 to LFC. Job done. #lfc
Sterling needs to play that to Suarez sooner. Too many touches.
What chances on Morgan starting against the Hammers? Otherwise maybe Cole or Shelvey up front?
Suarez suspended for Hammers game.
Superb run by Enrique!
Amazing FK from Suarez in the lead up!
YEEEEEEEES DAGGER SCORES!!!!!! #YNWA #lfc #LFCMatchDay
Aaaaaaaaagggghhh bloody woodwork!!! Shelvey belts it into the post.
Goal would be nice #lfc
Amazing dink lay off from Allen there for Suarez whose shot is parried away. Good to see Allen pushing up.
Gerrard's played a couple of genuine world class defence splitting passes, even if he's not finishing them of late at least he's creating.
Johnson is maintaining his excellent form down the right!!!
Good start from LFC. Have dominated possession and other than a Lambert long shot haven't been troubled in defence.
Welcome back Lucas!!!! #YNWA

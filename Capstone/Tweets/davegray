@scharlau @leanvoices just swallowed my silly price-sensitivity and bought the book. Look forward to reading it :)
@LeanVoices @scharlau just went to buy the book. $84 USD??? If you want to spread your message that seems a little steep for a business book
@scharlau sorry but I had not heard of Sense & Respond or @leanvoices -- will check out the book. Thanks for bringing it to my attention.
@Acluytens @alexosterwalder sounds like a plan!

@TCoughlin the exceptions (IMO) prove the possibility & point the way to the future. Today's exceptions are tomorrow's norms @jgombita
@TCoughlin people say dragons don't exist. So I show them some dragons. Then they say dragons aren't the norm. I agree. @jgombita
@TCoughlin of course. If it were the norm then there would be no reason to write a book. @jgombita

@rotkapchen @marciamarcia interesting. Agree that builds help understanding but hand-sketching may make infographics more accessible.
